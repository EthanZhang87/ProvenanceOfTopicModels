id: 59687
The Hillsborough disaster was a fatal crowd crush at a football match at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield South Yorkshire England on April It occurred during an FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest in the two standing only central pens within the Leppings Lane stand allocated to Liverpool supporters Shortly before kick off police match commander David Duckenfield ordered exit gate C to be opened in an attempt to ease crowding which led to an influx of supporters entering the pens This resulted in overcrowding of those pens and the fatal crush with a total of fatalities and injuries the disaster is the deadliest in British sporting history Ninety four people died on the day another person died in hospital days later and another died in In July a coroner ruled that Andrew Devine who died years later after suffering severe and irreversible brain damage on the day was the th victim The match was abandoned and restaged at Old Trafford in Manchester on May Liverpool won and went on to win that season s FA Cup br In the following days and weeks South Yorkshire Police SYP fed the press false stories suggesting that football hooliganism and drunkenness by Liverpool supporters had caused the disaster Blaming Liverpool fans persisted even after the Taylor Report of which found that the main cause was a failure of crowd control by SYP Following the Taylor Report the Director of Public Prosecutions ruled there was no evidence to justify prosecution of any individuals or institutions The disaster led to a number of safety improvements in the largest English football grounds notably the elimination of fenced standing terraces in favour of all seater stadiums in the top two tiers of English football br The first coroner s inquests into the Hillsborough disaster completed in concluded with verdicts of accidental death in respect of all the deceased Families disputed the findings and fought to have the case re opened In Lord Justice Stuart Smith concluded that there was no justification for a new inquiry Private prosecutions brought by the Hillsborough Family Support Group against Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray failed in In a Hillsborough Independent Panel was formed to review the evidence Reporting in it confirmed Taylor s criticisms and revealed details about the extent of police efforts to shift blame onto fans the role of other emergency services and the error of the first coroner s inquests The panel s report resulted in the previous findings of accidental death being quashed and the creation of new coroner s inquests It also produced two criminal investigations led by police in Operation Resolve to look into the causes of the disaster and by the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC to examine actions by police in the aftermath br The second coroner s inquests were held from April to April They ruled that the supporters were unlawfully killed owing to grossly negligent failures by police and ambulance services to fulfil their duty of care The inquests also found that the design of the stadium contributed to the crush and that supporters were not to blame for the dangerous conditions Public anger over the actions of their force during the second inquests led to the suspension of the SYP chief constable David Crompton following the verdict In June six people were charged with offences including manslaughter by gross negligence misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice for their actions during and after the disaster The Crown Prosecution Service subsequently dropped all charges against one of the defendants br br br Before the disaster br br br Venue br Hillsborough Stadium had been constructed in to house Sheffield Wednesday It was selected by the Football Association FA as a neutral venue to host the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs Kick off was scheduled for pm on April and fans were advised to take up positions minutes beforehand br At the time of the disaster most English football stadiums had high steel fencing between the spectators and the playing field in response to pitch invasions Hooliganism had affected the sport for some years and was particularly virulent in England From when these security standards were put in place crushes occurred in several English stadiums br A report by Eastwood Partners for a safety certificate for the stadium in concluded that although it failed to meet the recommendations of the Green Guide a guide to safety at sports grounds the consequences were minor It emphasised the general situation at Hillsborough was satisfactory compared with most grounds Sheffield Wednesday were later criticised for neglecting safety in the stadium especially after an incident in the semi final of the FA Cup The Leppings Lane end of the ground did not hold a valid safety certificate at the time of the disaster it had not been updated since br Risks associated with confining fans in pens were highlighted by the Committee of Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds the Popplewell inquiry after the Bradford City stadium fire in May It made recommendations on the safety of crowds penned within fences including that all exit gates should be manned at all times and capable of being opened immediately from the inside by anyone in an emergency br br br Previous incidents br Hillsborough hosted five FA Cup semi finals in the s During the semi final between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers a crush occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground after hundreds more spectators were permitted to enter the terrace than could safely be accommodated resulting in injuries including broken arms legs and ribs Police believed there would have been a real chance of fatalities had swift action not been taken and recommended that the club reduce its capacity In a post match briefing to discuss the incident Sheffield Wednesday chairman Bert McGee remarked Bollocks no one would have been killed The incident nonetheless prompted Sheffield Wednesday to alter the layout at the Leppings Lane end dividing the terrace into three separate pens to restrict sideways movement This particular change and other later alterations to the stadium invalidated the stadium s safety certificate which was not renewed and the stated capacity of the stadium was never changed The terrace was divided into five pens when the club was promoted to the First Division in and a crush barrier near the access tunnel was removed in to improve the flow of fans entering and exiting the central enclosure br After the crush in Hillsborough was not selected to host an FA Cup semi final again until Significant overcrowding was observed at the ground during that year s quarter final between Sheffield Wednesday and Coventry City and again during the semi final between Coventry City and Leeds United The Leeds fans were assigned the Leppings Lane end for the semi final one fan described disorganisation at the turnstiles and no steward or police direction inside the stadium resulting in the crowd in one enclosure becoming so compressed that he was at times unable to raise and clap his hands Other accounts told of fans having to be pulled to safety from above br Liverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi final at Hillsborough in and fans again reported crushing at the Leppings Lane end Liverpool lodged a complaint before the match in One supporter wrote to the Football Association and the Minister for Sport The whole area was packed solid to the point where it was impossible to move and where I and others around me felt considerable concern for personal safety br br br South Yorkshire Police command changes br South Yorkshire Police SYP presence at the previous year s FA Cup semi final also between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and also at Hillsborough Stadium had been overseen by Chief Superintendent Brian L Mole Mole had supervised numerous police deployments at the stadium in the past In October a probationary PC in Mole s F division South Yorkshire was handcuffed photographed and stripped by fellow officers in a fake robbery as a hazing prank Four officers resigned and seven were disciplined over the incident Chief Superintendent Mole himself was to be transferred to the Barnsley division for career development reasons The transfer was to be done with immediate effect on March br Meanwhile Hillsborough was accepted as the FA Cup semi final venue on March by the Football Association The first planning meeting for the semi final took place on March and was attended by newly promoted Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield not by Mole No known minutes exist of this meeting Although Mole could have been assigned the semi final match s planning despite his transfer that was not done This left planning for the semi final match to Duckenfield who had never commanded a sell out football match before and who had very little if any training or personal experience in how to do so br br br Disaster br br br Access to the stadium br As is common practice at domestic football matches in England opposing supporters were segregated in and around the stadium Nottingham Forest were allocated the South Stand and Spion Kop with a combined capacity of spectators reached by turnstiles spaced along the south and east sides of the ground Liverpool were allocated the North Stand and West Stand with a combined capacity of spectators reached by turnstiles from a narrow concourse off Leppings Lane Ten turnstiles numbered to provided access to seats in the North Stand six turnstiles numbered to provided access to seats in the upper tier of the West Stand and a further seven turnstiles lettered A to G gave access to standing places in the lower tier of the West Stand Although a greater number of Liverpool supporters were expected to attend the match Nottingham had been allocated the larger spectator area to avoid the approach routes of rival fans crossing As a result of the stadium layout and the segregation policy the additional turnstiles that would normally have allowed access to the North Stand from the east were not being used and the Liverpool fans were forced to converge on the single entrance at Leppings Lane On the day of the match radio and television broadcasters were advising anyone without a ticket not to attend Rather than establishing crowd safety as their top priority the clubs local authorities and police viewed their roles and responsibilities through the lens of hooliganism br br br Build up br Three chartered trains had transported Liverpool supporters to Sheffield for the semi final but only one such train was provided in The passengers arrived at the ground at about pm Many of the supporters wished to enjoy the day and were in no hurry to enter the stadium too early Some were delayed by roadworks while crossing the Pennines on the M motorway which resulted in minor traffic congestion Between pm and pm there was a build up of supporters outside the turnstiles facing Leppings Lane eager to enter the stadium before the game started At pm the BBC s football commentator John Motson had already noticed the uneven distribution of people in the Leppings Lane pens and while rehearsing for the match off air he had suggested a nearby cameraman look as well There s gaps you know in parts of the ground Well if you look at the Liverpool end to the right of the goal there s hardly anybody on those steps that s it Look down there br A bottleneck developed outside the stadium with more fans arriving than could be safely filtered through the turnstiles before the pm kick off People presenting tickets at the wrong turnstiles and those who had been refused entry were blocked from leaving because of the crowd behind them and remained as an obstruction Fans outside the ground could hear cheering as the teams came onto the pitch ten minutes before the start of the match and as the match kicked off but could not gain entrance A police constable radioed control requesting that the game be delayed as had happened in to ensure the safe passage of supporters into the ground but the request to delay the kick off by minutes was declined br By this time an estimated fans were trying to enter through the turnstiles Amid increasing safety concerns and to avoid fatalities outside the ground the police opened a large exit gate Gate C that ordinarily permitted the free flow of supporters departing the stadium after a match Two more gates A and B were subsequently opened to further relieve the pressure After an initial rush thousands of supporters entered the stadium steadily at a fast walk br br br Crush br When the gates were opened thousands of fans entered a narrow tunnel leading from the rear of the terrace into two overcrowded central pens pens and creating pressure at the front Hundreds of people were pressed against one another and the fencing by the weight of the crowd behind them People entering were unaware of the problems at the front of the pens police or stewards would normally stand at the entrance to the tunnel and if the central pens reached capacity they would direct people to the side pens but that did not happen on this occasion for reasons not fully explained br The match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest started at pm as scheduled Fans were still streaming into pens and from the rear entrance tunnel as the match began For some time problems at the front of the Liverpool central goal pens went largely unnoticed except by those inside the pens and a few police at that end of the pitch Liverpool s goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar later reported that fans behind him were pleading to him for help as the situation worsened At first the police made attempts to stop people from spilling out of the pens some believing this to be a pitch invasion At approximately pm a shot from Liverpool s Peter Beardsley hit the crossbar possibly connected to the excitement a surge in pen caused one of its metal crush barriers to give way br Police superintendent Roger Greenwood the most senior SYP officer in command inside the ground on the day realised the situation and ran onto the field to gain the attention of referee Ray Lewis who stopped the match at At this point people were climbing the fence at the front of the pens in an effort to escape the crush and get to the pitchside A small gate in the fence had been forced open and some fans managed to escape via this route while others continued to climb over the fencing Some were pulled to safety by people at the front of the upper tier of the West Stand above the Leppings Lane terrace The intensity of the crush broke more crush barriers on the terrace Holes were made in the perimeter fencing by fans desperately attempting to rescue others br The crowd in the Leppings Lane terrace spilled onto the pitch where the many injured and traumatised fans who had climbed to safety congregated The football players were ushered to their dressing rooms and informed that there would be a minute postponement The people still trapped in the pens were packed so tightly that many victims died of compressive asphyxia while standing Meanwhile on the pitch police stewards and members of the St John Ambulance service were overwhelmed Many uninjured fans were assisting the injured several attempted CPR and others tore down advertising hoardings to use as makeshift stretchers SYP chief superintendent John Nesbit later briefed Michael Shersby MP at a Police Federation meeting in October that allowing the fans to help with the rescue effort was a deliberate strategy otherwise they might have turned their frustration on the police br br br SYMAS response br The agreed protocol for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service SYMAS was that ambulances were to queue at the entrance to the gymnasium under the North Stand termed the casualty reception point or CRP Any individuals within the stadium that were seriously injured were to be delivered expeditiously by police and paramedics to the CRP to receive medical attention The system of ferrying injured from any location within the stadium to the CRP required a formal declaration to be made by those in charge for it to take effect As this declaration was not immediately performed there was confusion among those attempting to administer aid on the pitch This indecision migrated to the first responders waiting in ambulances at the CRP which quickly deteriorated into an ambulance car park Some crews were hesitant to leave their vehicles unsure of whether patients were coming to them or vice versa Others who did leave their vehicles were then faced with the obstacles inherent in placing distance between themselves and their equipment As the Panel explained in their report br br The equipment was no use on the ambulance vehicle when critical early resuscitation was taking place some distance away on the pitch behind the Leppings Lane end and in the gymnasium Some ambulance crew did take equipment when they left their vehicle but there was no systematic direction to do so not all did and none initially had been given any information about the situation inside the stadium br A total of ambulances arrived at the stadium Two ambulances managed to make their way onto the pitch of their own accord and a third entered the field at the direction of deputy chief ambulance officer Alan Hopkins who felt its visibility might allay crowd concerns The remaining ambulances were collectively able to transport approximately people to either Northern General Hospital Royal Hallamshire Hospital or Barnsley Hospital for treatment br The adverse comments of two doctors regarding the emergency response appeared in the media Their views were not a maverick view from a disaffected minority but the considered opinion of the majority of professionals present from the outset br br br Reactions br Condolences flooded in from across the world led by the Queen Other messages came from Pope John Paul II US President George H W Bush and the chief executive of Juventus fans of Liverpool and Juventus had been involved in the Heysel Stadium disaster amongst many others br Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Home Secretary Douglas Hurd visited Hillsborough the day after the disaster and met survivors Anfield stadium was opened on the Sunday to allow fans to pay tribute to the dead Thousands of fans visited and the stadium filled with flowers scarves and other tributes In the following days more than people visited the shrine inside the stadium The following Sunday a link of football scarves spanning the mile km distance across Stanley Park from Goodison Park to Anfield was created with the final scarf in position at pm Elsewhere on the same day a silence opened with an air raid siren at three o clock was held in central Nottingham with the colours of Forest Liverpool and Wednesday adorning Nottingham Council House br At Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral a requiem mass attended by people was held by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool Derek Worlock The first reading was read by Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar Liverpool players Ronnie Whelan Steve Nicol and former manager Joe Fagan carried the communion bread and wine br The FA chief executive Graham Kelly who had attended the match said the FA would conduct an inquiry into what had happened Speaking after the disaster Kelly backed all seater stadiums saying We must move fans away from the ritual of standing on terraces Standing on terraces and the use of perimeter fencing around the pitch the use of CCTV the timing of football matches and policing of sporting events were factors for a subsequent inquiry to consider br UEFA President Jacques Georges caused controversy by describing the Liverpool supporters as beasts wrongly suggesting that hooliganism was the cause of the disaster which had occurred less than four years after the Heysel Stadium disaster His remarks led to Liverpool F C calling for his resignation but he apologised on discovering hooliganism was not the cause br At the FA Cup Final between Liverpool and local rivals Everton held just five weeks after the Hillsborough disaster the players from both participating teams wore black armbands as a gesture of respect to the victims br During the final match of the English Football League season contested on May between Liverpool and second place Arsenal the Arsenal players presented flowers to fans in different parts of Anfield in memory of those who had died in the Hillsborough disaster br br br Disaster appeal fund br A disaster appeal fund was set up with donations of from the UK Government from Liverpool F C and each from the cities of Liverpool Sheffield and Nottingham The Liverpool F C donation was the amount the club would have received as its share of the match income had the semi final gone ahead as planned Within days donations had passed million swelled by donations from individuals schools and businesses Other fundraising activities included a Factory Records benefit concert and several fundraising football matches The two teams involved in the Bradford City stadium fire Bradford City and Lincoln City met for the first time since the disaster in a game that raised for the Hillsborough fund By the time the appeal closed in it had raised more than million Much of the money went to victims and relatives of those involved in the disaster and provided funds for a college course to improve the hospital phase of emergency care br In May a charity version of the Gerry and the Pacemakers song Ferry Cross the Mersey was released in aid of those affected The record was produced by Stock Aitken Waterman and featured Liverpool musicians Paul McCartney Gerry Marsden of the Pacemakers Holly Johnson and The Christians It entered the UK Singles Chart at number on May and remained at the top of the chart for three weeks Despite having stronger ties to Liverpool F C Gerry and the Pacemakers earlier hit You ll Never Walk Alone was not used because it had recently been re recorded for the Bradford City stadium fire appeal br br br Effect on survivors br By the disaster s th anniversary in at least three people who survived were known to have taken their own lives Another survivor had spent eight years in psychiatric care There were cases of alcoholism drug abuse and collapsed marriages involving people who had witnessed the events The lingering effects of the disaster were seen as a cause or contributory factor in all of these br br br Victims br In total ninety seven people died as a result of injuries incurred during the disaster Ninety four people aged from to years old died on the day either at the stadium in the ambulances or shortly after arrival at hospital A total of people were reported to have suffered injuries among whom were hospitalised The less seriously injured survivors who did not live in the Sheffield area were advised to seek treatment for their injuries at hospitals nearer to their homes On April the death toll reached when year old Lee Nicol died in hospital after being taken off life support The death toll reached in March when artificial feeding and hydration were withdrawn from year old Tony Bland after nearly four years during which time he had remained in a persistent vegetative state showing no sign of improvement br This followed a legal challenge in the High Court by his family to have his treatment withdrawn a landmark challenge which succeeded in November br Andrew Devine aged at the time of the disaster suffered similar injuries to Tony Bland and was also diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state In March just before the eighth anniversary of the disaster it was reported he had emerged from the condition and was able to communicate using a touch sensitive pad and he had been showing signs of awareness of his surroundings for up to three years before Devine died in as a consequence of the injuries sustained at Hillsborough with his death being ruled by the coroner to have been an unlawful killing raising the total death toll of the disaster to br Two sisters three pairs of brothers and a father and son were among those who died as were two men about to become fathers for the first time year old Steven Brown of Wrexham and year old Peter Thompson of Widnes Jon Paul Gilhooley aged was the youngest person to die His cousin Steven Gerrard then aged went on to become Liverpool F C s captain Gerrard has said the disaster inspired him to lead the team he supported as a boy and become a top professional football player The oldest person to die at Hillsborough was year old Gerard Baron an older brother of former Liverpool player Kevin Baron br Stephen Whittle is considered by some to be another victim of Hillsborough as due to work commitments he had sold his ticket to a friend whom he and his family chose not to identify who then died in the disaster the resulting feeling of survivor guilt is believed to be the main reason he took his own life at age in February br The majority of victims who died were from Liverpool and Greater Merseyside A further were from counties adjacent to Merseyside An additional three victims came from Sheffield with two more living in counties adjacent to South Yorkshire The remaining victims lived in other parts of England br br br Ages br Of those who died were aged under of whom were under and all but three of the victims were aged under br br br coroner s hearing br Inquests into the deaths were opened and adjourned immediately after the disaster br Resumed on November they proved to be controversial South Yorkshire coroner Dr Stefan Popper limited the main inquests to events up to pm on the day of the disaster nine minutes after the match was halted and the crowd spilt onto the pitch Popper said this was because the victims were either dead or brain dead by pm The decision angered the families many of whom felt the inquests were unable to consider the response of the police and other emergency services after that time The inquests returned verdicts of accidental death on March much to the dismay of the bereaved families who had been hoping for a verdict of unlawful killing or an open verdict and for manslaughter charges to be brought against the officers who had been present at the disaster Trevor Hicks whose two daughters had been killed described the verdicts as lawful but immoral br Popper s decision regarding the cut off time was subsequently endorsed by the Divisional Court who considered it to have been justified in the light of the medical evidence available to him Relatives later failed to have the inquests reopened to allow more scrutiny of police actions and closer examination of the circumstances of individual cases br Families believed that Popper was too close to the police After the verdicts Barry Devonside who had lost his son witnessed Popper hosting a celebration party with police officers br One of the individual cases where the circumstances of death were not fully resolved was that of Kevin Williams the fifteen year old son of Anne Williams Anne Williams who died in rejected the coroner s decision that the Hillsborough victims including her son had died before pm citing witness statements that described him showing signs of life at pm She unsuccessfully appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in The Hillsborough Independent Panel considered the available evidence and stated that the initial pathologist s opinion appeared definitive but further authoritative opinions raised significant doubts about the accuracy of that initial opinion br Popper had excluded the witness evidence of two qualified Merseyside doctors Drs Ashton and Phillips who had been inside the stadium on the day and who had been critical of the chaotic emergency response The views of both were dismissed by the Taylor report They both gave evidence at the Warrington inquests Phillips stated that the exclusion of their evidence was a serious error of judgement by Popper He said that he could not fathom why he didn t call us other than he specifically did not want to hear our evidence in which case the first inquests were coloured and flawed before they even started br Ashton and Phillips were not the only doctors present at the disaster not to be called to give evidence to the Popper inquests The only one called was the Sheffield Wednesday club doctor br br br Taylor Inquiry br br After the disaster Lord Justice Taylor was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the events The Taylor Inquiry sat for a total of days between May and June and published two reports an interim report August which laid out the events of the day and immediate conclusions and a final report January which outlined general recommendations on football ground safety The two publications together became known as the Taylor Report br Taylor concluded that policing on the day broke down and the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control Attention was focused on the decision to open the secondary gates moreover the kick off should have been delayed as had been done at other venues and matches br Sheffield Wednesday was also criticised for the inadequate number of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and the poor quality of the crush barriers on the terraces respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster br br br Police control br Taylor found there was no provision for controlling the entry of spectators into the turnstile area He dismissed the claim by senior police officers that they had no reason to anticipate problems since congestion had occurred at both the and semi finals He said that the Operational Order and police tactics on the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short period That it might so occur was foreseeable The failure by the police to give the order to direct fans to empty areas of the stadium was described by Taylor as a blunder of the first magnitude br There was no means for calculating when individual enclosures had reached capacity A police officer ordinarily made a visual assessment before guiding fans to other pens However on the day of the disaster by pm when gate C was opened pens and were over full to allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries to allow in a large stream was courting disaster br The report noted that the official capacity of the central pens was that the Health and Safety Executive found this should have been reduced to due to crush barriers and perimeter gates but actually an estimated people were in the pens around pm The report said When spectators first appeared on the track the immediate assumption in the control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened This was unlikely at the beginning of a match It became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch T here was no effective leadership either from control or on the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve pressure Further that The anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk of a crush due to overcrowding br Regarding the decision to allocate Liverpool spectators to the West and North Ends Taylor stated I do not consider choice of ends was causative of the disaster Had it been reversed the disaster could well have occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters br Lord Taylor noted with regard to the performance of the senior police officers in command that neither their handling of the problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be expected of their rank br br br Behaviour of fans br Lord Taylor concluded that the behaviour of Liverpool fans including accusations of drunkenness were secondary factors and said that most fans were not drunk nor even the worse for drink He concluded that this formed an exacerbating factor but that police seeking to rationalise their loss of control overestimated the element of drunkenness in the crowd br The report dismissed the theory put forward by South Yorkshire Police that fans attempting to gain entry without tickets or with forged tickets were contributing factors br br br Emergency response br Taylor concluded that in responding to the disaster there had been no fault on the part of the emergency services St John Ambulance South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and fire brigade br br br Police evasion br Taylor concluded his criticism of South Yorkshire Police by describing senior officers in command as defensive and evasive witnesses who refused to accept any responsibility for error In all some police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry Sadly I must report that for the most part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank Further stating South Yorkshire Police were not prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred T he police case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt br br br Effect on stadiums in Britain br br The Taylor Report had a deep impact on safety standards for stadiums in the UK Perimeter and lateral fencing was removed and many top stadiums were converted to all seated Purpose built stadiums for Premier League and most Football League teams since the report are all seater Chester City F C s Deva Stadium was the first English football stadium to fulfil the safety recommendations of the Taylor Report with Millwall F C s The Den being the first new stadium to be built that fulfilled the recommendations br In July the government announced a relaxation of the regulation for the lower two English leagues known now as League One and League Two The Football Spectators Act does not cover Scotland but the Scottish Premier League chose to make all seater stadiums a requirement of league membership In England and Wales all seating is a requirement of the Premier League and of the Football League for clubs who have been present in the Championship for more than three seasons br Several campaigns have attempted to get the government to relax the regulation and allow standing areas to return to Premiership and Championship grounds br br br Stuart Smith scrutiny br In May when the Labour Party came into office Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered an investigation It was performed by Lord Justice Stuart Smith The appointment of Stuart Smith was not without controversy At a meeting in Liverpool with relatives of those involved in Hillsborough in October he flippantly remarked Have you got a few of your people or are they like the Liverpool fans turn up at the last minute He later apologised for his remark saying it was not intended to offend The terms of reference of his inquiry were limited to new evidence that is evidence which was not available or was not presented to the previous inquiries courts or authorities Therefore evidence such as witness statements which had been altered were classed as inadmissible br When he presented his report in February he concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a new inquiry into the disaster In paragraph of his summary Lord Justice Stuart Smith said br br I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor s Inquiry There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken Nor do I consider that there is any justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the emergency and hospital services I have considered the circumstances in which alterations were made to some of the self written statements of South Yorkshire Police officers but I do not consider that there is any occasion for any further investigation br Importantly Stuart Smith s report supported the coroner s assertion that evidence after pm was inadmissible as that by pm the principal cause of death that is the crushing was over This was controversial as the subsequent response of the police and emergency services would not be scrutinised Announcing the report to the House of Commons Home Secretary Jack Straw backed Stuart Smith s findings and said that I do not believe that a further inquiry could or would uncover significant new evidence or provide any relief for the distress of those who have been bereaved However the determination by Stuart Smith was heavily criticised by the Justice Minister Lord Falconer who stated I am absolutely sure that Sir Murray Stuart Smith came completely to the wrong conclusion Falconer added It made the families in the Hillsborough disaster feel after one establishment cover up here was another br br br Hillsborough Independent Panel br The Hillsborough Independent Panel was instituted in by the British government to investigate the Hillsborough disaster to oversee the disclosure of documents about the disaster and its aftermath and to produce a report On September it published its report and simultaneously launched a website containing pages of material collated from organisations and individuals over two years br br br History br In the years after the disaster the Hillsborough Family Support Group had campaigned for the release of all relevant documents into the public domain After the disaster s th anniversary in April supported by the Culture Secretary Andy Burnham and Minister of State for Justice Maria Eagle the government asked the Home Office and Department of Culture Media and Sport to investigate the best way for this information to be made public In April the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced she had requested secret files concerning the disaster be made public br In December Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the Hillsborough Independent Panel s remit would be to oversee full public disclosure of relevant government and local information within the limited constraints set out in the disclosure protocol and consult with the Hillsborough families to ensure that the views of those most affected by the disaster are taken into account An archive of all relevant documentation would be created and a report produced within two years explaining the work of the panel and its conclusions br The panel was chaired by James Jones the Bishop of Liverpool Other members were br br Raju Bhatt human rights lawyer br Christine Gifford expert in the field of access to information br Katy Jones investigative journalist br Bill Kirkup Associate chief medical officer in the Department of Health br Paul Leighton former deputy chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland br Professor Phil Scraton expert in criminology br Peter Sissons broadcaster media br Sarah Tyacke former chief executive of the National Archives br br br Findings br On September the Hillsborough Independent Panel concluded that no Liverpool fans were responsible in any way for the disaster and that its main cause was a lack of police control Crowd safety was compromised at every level and overcrowding issues had been recorded two years earlier The panel concluded that up to of the who had died up to that date might have survived had the emergency services reactions and co ordination been better The number is based on post mortem examinations which found some victims may have had heart lung or blood circulation function for some time after being removed from the crush The report stated that placing fans who were merely unconscious on their backs rather than in the recovery position would have resulted in their deaths due to airway obstruction Their report was in pages and delivered key findings br The findings concluded that witness statements had been altered Of those statements were amended to remove or change negative comments about South Yorkshire Police South Yorkshire Police had performed blood alcohol tests on the victims some of them children and ran computer checks on the national police database in an attempt to impugn their reputation The report concluded that the then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam Irvine Patnick passed inaccurate and untrue information from the police to the press br The panel noted that despite being dismissed by the Taylor Report the idea that alcohol contributed to the disaster proved remarkably durable Documents disclosed confirm that repeated attempts were made to find supporting evidence for alcohol being a factor and that available evidence was significantly misinterpreted It noted The weight placed on alcohol in the face of objective evidence of a pattern of consumption modest for a leisure event was inappropriate It has since fuelled persistent and unsustainable assertions about drunken fan behaviour br The evidence it released online included altered police reports br br br Effects br Subsequent apologies were released by Prime Minister David Cameron on behalf of the government Ed Miliband on behalf of the opposition Sheffield Wednesday Football Club South Yorkshire Police and former editor of The Sun Kelvin MacKenzie who apologised for making false accusations under the headline The Truth MacKenzie said he should have written a headline that read The Lies although this apology was rejected by the Hillsborough Family Support Group and Liverpool fans as it was seen to be shifting the blame once again br After publication the Hillsborough Family Support Group called for new inquests for the victims They also called for prosecutions for unlawful killing corporate manslaughter and perversion of the course of justice in respect of the actions of the police both in causing the disaster and covering up their actions and in respect of Sheffield Wednesday FC Sheffield Council and the Football Association for their various responsibilities for providing certifying and selecting the stadium for the fatal event br Calls were made for the resignation of police officers involved in the cover up and for Sheffield Wednesday the police and the Football Association to admit their blame Calls were also made for Sir Dave Richards to resign as chairman of the Premier League and give up his knighthood as a result of his conduct at Sheffield Wednesday at the time of the disaster The Home Secretary called for investigations into law breaking and promised resources to investigate individual or systematic issues br On October Norman Bettison resigned with immediate effect as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police after Maria Eagle MP on the floor of the House and protected by parliamentary privilege accused him of boasting about concocting a story that all the Liverpool fans were drunk and police were afraid they were going to break down the gates and decided to open them Bettison denied the claim and other allegations about his conduct saying br br Fans behaviour to the extent that it was relevant at all made the job of the police in the crush outside Leppings Lane turnstiles harder than it needed to be But it didn t cause the disaster any more than the sunny day that encouraged people to linger outside the stadium as kick off approached I held those views then I hold them now I have never since hearing the Taylor evidence unfold offered any other interpretation in public or private br Merseyside Police Authority confirmed that Bettison would receive an pension unless convicted of a criminal offence Hillsborough families called for the payments to be frozen during the IPCC investigation In the same October House of Commons debate Stephen Mosley MP alleged West Midlands police pressured witnesses both police and civilians to change their statements Maria Eagle confirmed

the Hillsborough Inquests official website On April the nine jurors were sent out to consider their verdicts These were formally given to the inquests at on April The jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing in respect of all victims by majority verdict of Upon receiving the April verdict Hillsborough Family Support Group chair Margaret Aspinall whose year old son James was killed in the disaster said br br Let s be honest about this people were against us We had the media against us as well as the establishment Everything was against us The only people that weren t against us was our own city That s why I am so grateful to my city and so proud of my city They always believed in us br On the day after the verdicts were reached the Home Secretary Theresa May made a statement to Parliament which included the verdicts of the jury to the fourteen questions they had been asked regarding the roles of South Yorkshire police the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service Sheffield Wednesday football club and Hillsborough stadium s engineers and two specific questions specific relating to the time and cause of death for each of the dead In addition to the unlawful killing verdict the jury concluded that errors or omissions by police commanding officers Sheffield Wednesday the ambulance service and the design and certification of the stadium had all caused or contributed to the deaths but that the behaviour of football supporters had not In all but one case the jury recorded the time of death as later than the pm cut off point adopted by the coroner at the original inquests br Prime Minister David Cameron also responded to the April verdict by saying that it represented a long overdue but landmark moment in the quest for justice adding All families and survivors now have official confirmation of what they always knew was the case that the Liverpool fans were utterly blameless in the disaster that unfolded at Hillsborough The Labour Party described the handling of the Hillsborough disaster as the greatest miscarriage of justice of our times with Labour MPs Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram calling for accountability and the prosecution of those responsible Liberal Democrat MP John Pugh called for David Cameron to make a formal apology in the House of Commons to the families of those killed at Hillsborough and to the city of Liverpool as a whole br Echoing his expression of regret former Home Secretary Jack Straw apologised to the families for the failures of his review of the disaster br Kelvin MacKenzie who wrote the now infamous The Truth front page for the Sun said that although he was duped into publishing his story that his heart goes out to the families of those affected saying that It s quite clear today the fans had nothing to do with it However MacKenzie did not accept any personal responsibility for the story br During the inquests Maxwell Groome a police constable at the time of the disaster made allegations of a high level conspiracy by Freemasons to shift blame for the disaster onto Superintendent Roger Marshall also that junior officers were pressured into changing their statements after the disaster and told not to write their accounts in their official police pocketbooks Groome also claimed that match commander Duckenfield was a member of the highly influential Dole lodge in Sheffield the same lodge as Brian Mole his predecessor Coroner Sir John Goldring warned the jury that there was not a shred of evidence that any Masonic meeting actually took place or that those named were all Freemasons advising the jury to cast aside gossip and hearsay During the inquests Duckenfield confirmed that he became a Freemason in and became Worshipful Master of his local lodge in a year after the disaster following this revelation Freemasons were forbidden to take part in the IPCC investigation and Operation Resolve as civilian investigators to prevent any perceived bias br br br Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation br Following the inquests verdicts South Yorkshire police announced it would refer the actions of its officers to the Independent Police Complaints Commission IPCC West Yorkshire Police announced it would refer its Chief Constable Norman Bettison to the IPCC in mid September Bettison had been one of a number of police officers who were accused by the Hillsborough Independent Panel of manipulating evidence In early October Bettison announced his retirement becoming the first senior figure to step down since publication of the panel s report br The IPCC announced on October that it would investigate the failure of the police to declare a major incident failure to close the tunnel to the stands which led to overcrowded pens despite evidence it had been closed in such circumstances in the past changes made to the statements of police officers actions which misled Parliament and the media shortcomings of previous investigations and the role played by Norman Bettison br By October the names of at least serving and former police officers had been referred to the IPCC investigation In its announcement the IPCC praised the tenacity of the Hillsborough families campaign for truth and justice On October the Attorney General announced in Parliament he had applied to have the original inquests verdicts quashed arguing it proceeded on a false basis and evidence now to hand required this exceptional step br On July it was reported that the IPCC had found that in addition to the now police statements known to have been altered a further police officers had changed their statements Deborah Glass deputy chair of the IPCC said We know the people who have contacted us are the tip of the iceberg That was after the IPCC s Hillsborough Contact team had received pieces of correspondence since October br The IPCC is also investigating the actions of West Midlands Police who in had been tasked with investigating South Yorkshire Police s conduct for both the original inquests and also the Taylor independent inquiry br In April the Crown Prosecution Service announced that it would consider bringing charges against both individuals and corporate bodies once the criminal investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission Operation Resolve had been completed br br br The patronising disposition of unaccountable power report br br In April the then Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the Right Reverend James Jones Bishop of Liverpool from to to produce a report on the experiences of the Hillsborough families in the hope that their pain and suffering would not be repeated and that their perspective would not be lost After carrying out a thorough review Jones published his report titled The patronising disposition of unaccountable power A report to ensure that the pain and suffering of the Hillsborough families is not repeated on November Having met the Hillsborough families in one to one meetings and group sessions whilst compiling his report Jones was able to include numerous first hand accounts of their encounters with private and public authorities br The report identified points of learning of which the following drew particular attention br br Charter for Families Bereaved through Public Tragedy a series of commitments by public bodies to change related to transparency and acting in the public interest br Proper participation of bereaved families at inquests including publicly funded legal representation for bereaved families at inquests at which public bodies are legally represented an end to public bodies spending limitless sums and a change in the way that public bodies approach inquests br A duty of candour for police officers requiring them to cooperate fully with investigations into alleged criminal offences or misconduct as undertaken by the Independent Police Complaints Commission or its successor body br In the report James also called for the government to give full consideration to a proposed Public Authority Accountability Bill known informally as The Hillsborough Law which would include a legal duty of candour on public authorities and officials to be truthful and to proactively cooperate with official investigations and inquiries The full text of the draft bill was provided as an appendix to his report br Six years after the report was published on December the government issued its response and signed the Hillsborough Charter giving a commitment to transparency following a public tragedy However the proposal for a Hillsborough Law was rejected as it was considered by the government to be not necessary br br br Criminal and civil cases br br br Prosecutions br In February a private prosecution was brought against Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and another officer Bernard Murray The prosecution argued that the crush was foreseeable hence the defendants were grossly negligent Prosecutor Alun Jones told the court that Duckenfield gave the order to open the gates so that hundreds of fans could be herded onto the already crowded terraces at the stadium Jones stated that minutes after the disaster Duckenfield deceitfully and dishonestly told senior FA officials that the supporters had forced the gate open Duckenfield admitted that he had lied in certain statements regarding the causes of the disaster The prosecution ended on July when Murray was acquitted and the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Duckenfield On July the judge refused the prosecution s application for a retrial of Duckenfield br Police disciplinary charges were abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and because Murray was unavailable it was decided not to proceed with disciplinary charges against him Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension br Home Secretary Theresa May announced on December that a new police inquiry would be initiated to examine the possibility of charging agencies other than the police over the Hillsborough deaths The inquiry was first headed by former Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart and later by Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley br On June it was announced that six people were to be charged with offences in relation to the disaster Former Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in charge of the match faced counts of manslaughter by gross negligence He faced no charge in respect of the death of Tony Bland who died four years after the disaster Former Chief Inspector Sir Norman Bettinson faced four counts of misconduct in public office Former Sheffield Wednesday F C Club Secretary Graham Mackrell faced a charge of breaching the Safety at Sports Ground Act Solicitor Peter Metcalf former Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and former Detective Chief Inspector Alan Foster were all charged with perverting the course of justice for having altered police officers statements in order to mask the failings of the police force br On August all except Duckenfield appeared at Warrington Magistrates Court Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the charge against him No formal pleas were taken from the other four defendants All five were bailed to appear at the Crown Court in September Duckenfield was not required to appear as the Crown Prosecution Service CPS needed to apply to the High Court to lift a court order before he could be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges On June a ruling was made that Duckenfield would be prosecuted on the manslaughter charges br It was announced in December that a police officer and a farrier would not be prosecuted over allegations that they fabricated a story about a police horse being burned with cigarettes at Hillsborough Although there was enough evidence to charge the farrier with perverting the course of justice it was felt not to be in the public interest to charge him There was insufficient evidence against the police officer to charge him with the offence br On August it was announced that all charges against Bettison were being dropped as the CPS felt that there was insufficient evidence to have a realistic chance of a conviction The death of two witnesses and contradictions in the evidence of others were cited as part of the reason for the decision Representatives of the victims of the disaster stated that they would be asking for an independent review of the decision under the Right to Review Scheme br At a trial preparation hearing at Preston Crown Court on September Duckenfield pleaded not guilty to all charges against him Mackrell pleaded not guilty to the two charges against him A provisional trial date was set for January on which date the trial started at Preston Crown Court before Mr Justice Openshaw br On March it was reported that Duckenfield would not be called to give evidence in his defence It was also reported that the jury would be directed to find Mackrell not guilty on the charge of contravening the stadium s safety certificate due to a lack of evidence On April the jury returned with a guilty verdict against Mackrell on a health and safety charge but was unable to reach a verdict on Duckenfield It was announced on June that Duckenfield would face a retrial which was scheduled to start on October at Preston Crown Court On November Duckenfield was found not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter br On May Denton Foster and Metcalfe were all found not guilty of perverting the course of justice by altering police officers statements when Mr Justice William Davis found that they had no case to answer The reason given was that the public inquiry in to which the altered statements were submitted was not a statutory inquiry and therefore not a Court of Law Consequently a course of public justice could not have been perverted The ruling also noted that the original statements had neither been destroyed nor had they been ordered to be destroyed br In response to the acquittals Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees Mogg called the lack of accountability over Hillsborough the greatest scandal of British policing of our lifetimes Garston and Halewood MP Maria Eagle called for the law to be changed to prevent another catastrophic failure of justice br br br Psychiatric injury and other litigation br Various negligence cases were brought against the police by spectators who had been at the ground but had not been in the pens and by people who watched the incident unfolding on television or heard about it on the radio A case Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police A C was eventually appealed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and was an important milestone in the law of claims of secondary victims for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury It was held that claimants who watched the disaster on television listened on radio were not proximal and their claims were rejected br Another psychiatric injury claim was brought to the House of Lords White v Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police A C It was brought by police officers on duty against the chief constable who was said to have been vicariously liable for the disaster Their claims were dismissed and the Alcock decision was upheld It affirmed the position of the courts once again towards claims of psychiatric injuries of secondary victims br A third legal case which resulted from the Hillsborough disaster was Airedale N H S Trust v Bland A C a landmark House of Lords decision in English criminal law that allowed the life support machine of Tony Bland a Hillsborough victim in a persistent vegetative state to be switched off br In April an action was launched in the High Court on behalf of victims relatives against both SYP and the West Midlands Police force who had investigated the actions of SYP alleging misfeasance in public office involving a concerted cover up designed to shift blame away from the police An agreement was reached to settle the case in April but reporting restrictions were put in place due to the pending trial of Denton Foster and Metcalf Following the finding that they did not have a case to answer the restrictions were lifted br br br Proposed Hillsborough Law br A Public Authority Accountability Bill or a Hillsborough Law has been proposed by bereaved families of various such

Hillsborough The Truth the Heysel factor and hooligan hysteria began to shift the blame onto the behaviour of the Liverpool fans at the stadium making it a public order issue As well as The Sun s April The Truth article see below other newspapers published similar allegations the Daily Star headline on the same day reported Dead fans robbed by drunk thugs the Daily Mail accused the Liverpool fans of being drunk and violent and their actions were vile and The Daily Express ran a story alleging that Police saw sick spectacle of pilfering from the dying Peter McKay in the Evening Standard wrote that the catastrophe was caused first and foremost by violent enthusiasm for soccer and in this case the tribal passions of Liverpool supporters who literally killed themselves and others to be at the game and published a front page headline Police attack vile fans on April in which police sources blamed the behaviour of a section of Liverpool fans for the disaster br In Liverpool local journalist John Williams of the Liverpool Daily Post wrote in an article titled I Blame the Yobs that The gatecrashers wreaked their fatal havoc Their uncontrolled fanaticism and mass hysteria literally squeezed the life out of men women and children yobbism at its most base Scouse killed Scouse for no better reason than men were kicking a ball br In other regional newspapers the Manchester Evening News wrote that the Anfield Army charged on to the terrace behind the goal many without tickets and the Yorkshire Post wrote that the trampling crush had been started by thousands of fans who were latecomers forc ing their way into the ground The Sheffield Star published similar allegations to The Sun running the headline Fans in Drunken Attacks on Police br Many of the more serious allegations such as stealing from the dead and assault of police officers and rescue workers appeared on April although several evening newspapers published on April also gave inaccurate reporting of the disaster as these newspapers went to press before the full extent or circumstances of the disaster had been confirmed or even reported This included the Wolverhampton based Express Star which reported that the match had been cancelled as a result of a pitch invasion in which many fans were injured This article was presumably published before there were any reports that people had been killed These media reports and others were examined during the Hillsborough Independent Panel report br br br The Sun br br On April four days after the disaster Kelvin MacKenzie editor of The Sun ordered The Truth as the front page headline followed by three sub headlines Some fans picked pockets of victims Some fans urinated on the brave cops and Some fans beat up PC giving kiss of life Mackenzie reportedly spent two hours deciding on which headline to run his original instinct being for You Scum before eventually deciding on The Truth br The information was provided to the newspaper by Whites News Agency in Sheffield the newspaper cited claims by police inspector Gordon Sykes that Liverpool fans had pickpocketed the dead as well as other claims by unnamed police officers and local Conservative MP Irvine Patnick The Daily Express also carried Patnick s version under the headline Police Accuse Drunken Fans which gave Patnick s views saying he had told Margaret Thatcher while escorting her on a tour of the ground after the disaster of the mayhem caused by drunks and that policemen told him they were hampered harassed punched and kicked br The story accompanying The Sun headlines claimed drunken Liverpool fans viciously attacked rescue workers as they tried to revive victims and police officers firemen and ambulance crew were punched kicked and urinated upon A quotation attributed to an unnamed policeman claimed a partially unclothed dead girl had been verbally abused and that Liverpool fans were openly urinating on us and the bodies of the dead In fact many Liverpool fans helped security personnel stretcher away victims and gave first aid to the injured The Guardian later wrote that The claim that supporters higher up the Leppings Lane terrace had urinated on police pulling bodies out of the crush appeared to have roots in the fact that those who were dying or sustaining serious injuries suffered compression asphyxia and many involuntarily urinated vomited and emptied their bowels as they were crushed br In their history of The Sun Peter Chippendale and Chris Horrie wrote br br As MacKenzie s layout was seen by more and more people a collective shudder ran through the office but MacKenzie s dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch Everyone in the office seemed paralysed looking like rabbits in the headlights as one hack described them The error staring them in the face was too glaring It obviously wasn t a silly mistake nor was it a simple oversight Nobody really had any comment on it they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in wonder at the enormity of it It was a classic smear br MacKenzie maintained for years that his only mistake was to believe a Tory MP In he told a House of Commons committee I regret Hillsborough It was a fundamental mistake The mistake was I believed what an MP said but privately said at a dinner that he had only apologised under the instruction of Rupert Murdoch believing all I did wrong was tell the truth I was not sorry then and I m not sorry now On Question Time the next year MacKenzie publicly repeated the claims he said at the dinner he said that he believed some of the material they published in The Sun but was not sure about all of it He said in Twenty three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong A member of the Hillsborough Family Support Group responded too little too late br Widespread boycotts of the newspaper throughout Merseyside followed immediately and continue to this day Boycotts include both customers refusing to purchase it and retailers refusing to stock it The Financial Times reported in that Merseyside sales were estimated to drop from per day to per day an decrease Chris Horrie estimated in that the tabloid s owners had lost million per month since the disaster in prices The Hillsborough Justice Campaign organised a less successful national boycott that had some impact on the paper s sales nationally br In after Wayne Rooney gave exclusive interviews to The Sun causing backlash in Liverpool The Sun ran a front page story apologising for the most terrible mistake in its history saying We long ago apologised publicly We gladly say sorry again today fully openly honestly and without reservation It said criticism of Rooney was wrong and co ordinated by the Liverpool Echo and Liverpool Post The Liverpool Echo condemned the apology as cynical and shameless In under the headline The Real Truth The Sun made a front page apology saying we are profoundly sorry for false reports The editor at the time Dominic Mohan wrote We published an inaccurate and offensive story about the events at Hillsborough We said it was the truth it wasn t for that we re deeply ashamed and profoundly sorry Following the second inquest in The Sun s eighth and ninth pages carried images of the victims and an editorial which apologised unreservedly saying the police smeared supporters with a pack of lies which in the Sun and other media swallowed whole A lengthier apology was published online br br James Murdoch made a full apology for The Sun s coverage when he appeared at a hearing of the House of Commons Select committee dealing with the News International phone hacking scandal in br On September after the publication of the report exonerating the Liverpool fans MacKenzie issued the following statement br br Today I offer my profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool for that headline I too was totally misled Twenty three years ago I was handed a piece of copy from a reputable news agency in Sheffield in which a senior police officer and a senior local MP were making serious allegations against fans in the stadium I had absolutely no reason to believe that these authority figures would lie and deceive over such a disaster As the prime minister has made clear these allegations were wholly untrue and were part of a concerted plot by police officers to discredit the supporters thereby shifting the blame for the tragedy from themselves It has taken more than two decades documents and a two year inquiry to discover to my horror that it would have been far more accurate had I written the headline The Lies rather than The Truth I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong br In response Trevor Hicks chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group rejected MacKenzie s apology as too little too late calling him lowlife clever lowlife but lowlife A press conference held by families of the victims also banned all Sun reporters from entering with a sign on the door reading NO ENTRY TO SUN JOURNALISTS br Following the April verdict of unlawful killing The Sun and the first print edition of the Times both owned by News International did not cover the stories on their front pages with The Sun relegating the story to pages and An apology appeared on page reiterating previous statements that the headline had been an error of judgement br The coverage was widely condemned on social media with Twitter users saying that this reflected Murdoch s view on Hillsborough which was a smear which now daren t speak its name On the night of the verdict coverage more than tweets used the term The Sun br However on Sky News The Sun s Political Editor Tom Newton Dunn defended this decision saying I don t think it should all be about The Sun it was not us who committed Hillsborough Trevor Kavanagh the political editor at the time of the Hillsborough disaster said that he was not sorry at all about the reporting and supported his former boss Kelvin MacKenzie stating that we were clearly misled about the events and the authorities including the police actively concealed the truth br In February Liverpool F C issued a ban on The Sun journalists from entering their grounds in response to the coverage of Hillsborough by the newspaper Everton F C followed in April on the eve of the th anniversary of the disaster after a column by Kelvin MacKenzie concerning Everton footballer Ross Barkley MacKenzie was suspended as a contributor to the newspaper br br br The Times br The journalist Edward Pearce was criticised for writing a controversial article in the aftermath of the disaster at a time when a number of victims funerals were taking place His column in The Sunday Times on April included the text br br For the second time in half a decade a large body of Liverpool supporters has killed people the shrine in the Anfield goalmouth the cursing of the police all the theatricals come sweetly to a city which is already the world capital of self pity There are soapy politicians to make a pet of Liverpool and Liverpool itself is always standing by to make a pet of itself Why us Why are we treated like animals To which the plain answer is that a good and sufficient minority of you behave like animals br Pearce went on to reflect that if South Yorkshire Police bore any responsibility it was for not realising what brutes they had to handle br Professor Phil Scraton described Pearce s comments as amongst the most bigoted and factually inaccurate published in the wake of the disaster A number of complaints were made to the Press Council concerning the article but the Council ruled that it was unable to adjudicate on comment pieces though the Council noted that tragedy or disaster is not an occasion for writers to exercise gratuitous provocation br On April Times staffers in the sports department expressed their outrage over the paper s decision to cover April inquest which ruled that the dead were unlawfully killed only on an inside spread and the sports pages with some in the newspaper claiming there was a mutiny in the sports department The Times later tweeted that We made a mistake with the front page of our first edition and we fixed it for our second edition br The Times was the only major UK newspaper not to give the story front page coverage other than fellow News UK owned Sun Gary Lineker described the incident as disgusting as it is unsurprising and David Walsh chief sports writer at the Sunday Times said it was a shocking misjudgment to not include this story on the front page However insiders dismissed any suggestion that a visit by News UK owner Rupert Murdoch to the Times newsroom on the day of the verdict had anything to do with the editorial decision br br br FHM br The November edition of the men s lifestyle magazine FHM in Australia was swiftly withdrawn from sale soon after its publication and a public apology made in the Australian and British editions because it contained jokes mocking the disaster As a result Emap Australia who owned FHM at the time pledged to make a donation to the families of the victims Although the original apology was not printed in the magazine as it was not considered serious enough its Australian editor Geoff Campbell released a statement We deeply regret the photograph captions published in the November issue of the Australian edition of FHM accompanying an article about the Hillsborough disaster of The right course of action is to withdraw this edition from sale which we will be doing We have been in contact with the Hillsborough Family Support Group and the Hillsborough Justice Campaign to express our deep regret and sincere apologies The British edition disassociated itself from the controversy stating FHM Australia has its own editorial team and these captions were written and published without consultation with the UK edition or any other edition of FHM br The vice chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group Philip Hammond said he wanted all football fans to boycott the magazine saying I am going to write to every fanzine in the country including Liverpool F C s telling them to ban FHM People are very upset by it I think there will be a real boycott He added it would be like making jokes about the Bali bombings in which Australians were killed The publication was finally discontinued in for unrelated reasons br br br The Spectator br The Spectator was criticised for an editorial which appeared in the magazine on October following the death of British hostage Kenneth John Ken Bigley in Iraq in which it was claimed that the response to Bigley s killing was fuelled by the fact he was from Liverpool and went on to criticise the drunken fans at Hillsborough and call on them to accept responsibility for their role in the disaster br br The extreme reaction to Mr Bigley s murder is fed by the fact that he was a Liverpudlian Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community A combination of economic misfortune its docks were fundamentally on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar and deeply unattractive psyche among many Liverpudlians They see themselves whenever possible as victims and resent their victim status yet at the same time they wallow in it Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes but seek rather to blame someone else for it thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society The deaths of more than Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death however horrible of Mr Bigley but that is no excuse for Liverpool s failure to acknowledge even to this day the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd
