William Shankly September September was a Scottish football player and manager who is best known for his time as manager of Liverpool Shankly brought success to Liverpool gaining promotion to the First Division and winning three League Championships and the UEFA Cup He laid foundations on which his successors Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan were able to build by winning seven league titles and four European Cups in the ten seasons after Shankly retired in A charismatic iconic figure at the club his oratory stirred the emotions of the fanbase In years after Shankly arrived at Liverpool Tony Evans of The Independent wrote Shankly created the idea of Liverpool transforming the football club by emphasising the importance of the Kop and making supporters feel like participants br Shankly came from a small Scottish mining community and was one of five brothers who played football professionally He played as a ball winning right half and was capped twelve times for Scotland including seven wartime internationals He spent one season at Carlisle United before spending the rest of his career at Preston North End with whom he won the FA Cup in His playing career was interrupted by his service in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War He became a manager after he retired from playing in returning to Carlisle United He later managed Grimsby Town Workington and Huddersfield Town before moving to become Liverpool manager in December br Shankly took charge of Liverpool when they were in the Second Division and rebuilt the team into a major force in English and European football He led Liverpool to the Second Division Championship to gain promotion to the top flight First Division in before going on to win three First Division Championships two FA Cups four Charity Shields and one UEFA Cup It was during Shankly s tenure that the club changed to an all red home strip and You ll Never Walk Alone became the club s anthem Shankly announced his surprise retirement from football a few weeks after Liverpool had won the FA Cup Final having managed the club for years and was succeeded by his long time assistant Bob Paisley He led the Liverpool team out for the last time at Wembley for the FA Charity Shield He died seven years later aged Considered one of the greatest football managers of all time Shankly was among the inaugural inductees into the English Football Hall of Fame in and the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in br br br Early life br br Bill Shankly was born in the small Scottish coal mining village of Glenbuck Ayrshire whose population in the year of Shankly s birth was around People born there would often move to find work in larger coal mines As a result Glenbuck became largely derelict and by the time Shankly s ghost writer John Roberts visited it in there were only houses left including a cottage owned by Shankly s sister Elizabeth whom Roberts described as the last of the children of Glenbuck br Shankly s parents John and Barbara lived in one of the Auchenstilloch Cottages with their children five boys and five girls William was the ninth child and the youngest boy Although he was known as Bill throughout his football career his name in the family was Willie pronounced Wullie His father was a postman who became a tailor of handmade suits Despite the football pedigree in his family he did not play himself br All five Shankly brothers played professional football and Shankly claimed they could have beaten any five brothers in the world when they were all at their peaks His brothers were Alec known as Sandy by the family who played for Ayr United and Clyde Jimmy who played for various clubs including Sheffield United and Southend United John who played for Portsmouth and Luton Town and Bob who played for Alloa Athletic and Falkirk Bob became a successful manager guiding Dundee to victory in the Scottish championship in and the semi finals of the European Cup the following year Their maternal uncles Robert and William Blyth were professional players who both became club directors at Portsmouth and Carlisle United respectively br Shankly wrote in his autobiography that times were hard during his upbringing and that hunger was a prevailing condition especially during the winter months He admitted that he and his friends used to steal vegetables from nearby farms bread biscuits and fruit from suppliers wagons and bags of coal from the pits Shankly admitted the act was wrong but insisted it was done out of devilment only because the root cause was their constant hunger He said that he and his friends learned from their mistakes and became better people in later years He was at school from age five until Discipline at both home and school was strict but Shankly said it was character building His favourite subject was geography and he played football as often as possible especially in the school playground but there was no organised school team br After Shankly left school in he worked at a local mine alongside his brother Bob He did this for two years until the pit closed and he faced unemployment In his autobiography he described the life of a miner at some length and mentioned many of the problems such as the sheer hard work rats the difficulties of eating and drinking at the coal face The worst problem was the filth because the miners never felt really clean even though they would go home to wash in a tub after each shift br While Shankly was employed as a miner he played football as often as possible and sometimes went to Glasgow to watch either Celtic or Rangers sharing his allegiance between the two and ignoring the sectarianism that divides Glasgow Shankly developed his skills to the point that he was unemployed for only a few months before Carlisle United signed him He wrote that he had his football future worked out in his mind and that even when working in the pit he was only killing time He always believed that it was only a matter of time before he became a professional player He explained that in football terms he had always been an optimist with a belief in his destiny and that was the basis of his undying enthusiasm for the sport br Shankly s village team was called the Glenbuck Cherrypickers a name probably derived from the th Hussars the Cherry Pickers but he said the club was near extinction when he had a trial and he never actually played for them Shankly aged then played part of the season for Cronberry Eglinton about miles from Glenbuck He used to cycle to and from the ground Cronberry were in the Cumnock District League Although Shankly had less than one full season at Cronberry he acknowledged his debt to Scottish Junior Football as he learned a lot mainly by listening to older players and especially his brothers br br br Playing career br br br Carlisle United br Shankly had a single season at Carlisle United then relatively new to the Football League and playing in the Third Division North their reserve side playing in the North Eastern League Shankly was recommended by a scout called Peter Carruthers who had seen him playing for Cronberry He was invited for a month s trial and said it was the first time he had left Scotland He was signed after just one trial match for Carlisle s reserves against Middlesbrough reserves even though Carlisle reserves lost the match A local newspaper report said that he had worked hard and might develop into a useful left back In fact he developed into a top class right half br Shankly made his senior debut on December in a draw against Rochdale and made appearances for the first team At the end of the season the reserves won the North Eastern League Cup defeating Newcastle United reserves in the final In his autobiography Shankly stated that he still had the medal br At this stage of his career Shankly was assessed as a hard running gritty right half whose displays brought him much praise and credit He was considered a promising key young player who was capable of taking Carlisle to greater things He was paid four pounds ten shillings a week at Carlisle which he considered a good wage as the top rate at that time was eight pounds Shankly was happy at Carlisle which was close to his home at Glenbuck and he had settled in well with almost a guarantee of first team football When the opportunity came for him to move on he was not convinced he wanted to leave br br br Preston North End br Soon after the season ended Shankly received a telegram from Carlisle United asking him to return as soon as possible because another club wanted to sign him Arriving at Carlisle he discovered that the interested club was Preston North End who had offered a transfer fee of The terms for Shankly personally were a fee of plus a signing on fee and wages of five pounds a week equivalent to in Shankly s initial reaction was that it was not enough and the deal nearly fell through His brother Alec pointed out to him that Preston were in the Second Division and a bigger club than Carlisle with the potential to regain First Division status Alec persuaded him that the opportunity was more important than what he would be paid immediately stressing that it was what he would get later that counted Shankly took his brother s advice and signed the Preston contract in a railway carriage br Shankly began his Preston career in the reserves who played in the Central League which was a higher standard than the North Eastern League He made his first team debut on December three months after his th birthday against Hull City Shankly created an early goal to help Preston win earning him praise in a national newspaper for his clever passing With his wholehearted attitude and commitment to the team he quickly established himself as a first team regular and became a crowd favourite Preston fulfilled their potential and gained promotion to the First Division as runners up to Grimsby Town It was therefore a successful debut season for Shankly who stayed with Preston until he retired in His wage was increased to eight pounds a week with six pounds in the summer In a summary of the season a Preston correspondent Walter Pilkington wrote br br One of this season s discoveries Bill Shankly played with rare tenacity and uncommonly good ideas for a lad of He is full of good football and possessed with unlimited energy he should go far br In his autobiography Shankly wrote that Preston had more than held their own in the season and the club was not relegated again until the end of the season in which he left them Shankly developed into a tough half back as good as any in the Football League The outstanding Northern Ireland international Peter Doherty recalled how Shankly dogged his footsteps in one match and kept muttering Great wee team North End great wee team subduing Doherty completely as Preston defeated Manchester City br In Preston reached the FA Cup Final but were well beaten by Sunderland at Wembley Stadium Preston recovered to reach the FA Cup Final in which they defeated Huddersfield Town with a penalty scored by George Mutch in the final minute of extra time As well as winning the FA Cup Preston finished third in the league That season marked the pinnacle of Shankly s playing career br Shankly had just reached his th birthday when the Second World War began and the war claimed the peak years of his playing career He joined the Royal Air Force RAF and managed to play in numerous wartime league cup and exhibition matches for Norwich City Arsenal Luton Town Cardiff City Lovell s Athletic F C and Partick Thistle depending on where he was stationed winning the Summer Cup with the Glasgow club in On May he played a single game for Liverpool in a win over Everton at Anfield Shankly was keen on boxing and fought as a middleweight in the RAF winning a trophy when he was stationed in Manchester He confirmed in his autobiography that his weight as an RAF boxer was pounds kg and he was only six pounds kg heavier than that in Shankly met his wife Nessie in the RAF she was in the WAAF and stationed at the same camp and they married in br With the resumption of full League football again in the season Shankly returned to Preston who held his registration but he was now and coming to the end of his playing days By he was Preston s club captain but had lost his place in the first team which was struggling against relegation despite having Tom Finney in the side Shankly was a qualified masseur and had decided he wanted to become a coach so when Carlisle United asked him to become their manager in March of that year he retired as a player and accepted the job Shankly s departure from Preston was resented by some at the club and he was refused a benefit match to which he felt entitled He described Preston s attitude as the biggest let down of his life in football br Shankly had enormous admiration for Tom Finney and devotes more than three pages of his autobiography to Finney s prowess as a footballer In the s Shankly was asked how a current star compared to Finney and Shankly replied Aye he s as good as Tommy but then Tommy s nearly now Another Preston player admired by Shankly was his Scottish international teammate Andy Beattie with whom he would later work in management Shankly was succeeded in the Preston team by Tommy Docherty and Shankly told Docherty that he should just put the number four shirt on and let it run round by itself because it knows where to go br br br Scotland br Shankly played for Scotland times from to in five full and seven wartime internationals He spoke of his unbelievable pride when playing for Scotland against England and how when confronted by the Auld Enemy the Scottish players would become William Wallace or Robert the Bruce for minutes after pulling on the blue jersey Shankly himself certainly had that spirit when playing for Scotland as confirmed by Alex James who said of Shankly He is a real Scotland player who will fight until he drops br Shankly made his international debut on April against England at Wembley Scotland winning the match with a late goal by Tommy Walker Nine of his Scotland appearances were against England and the others were against Northern Ireland Wales and Hungary He was Scotland s captain in the wartime match against England at Hampden Park attended by people on May but Scotland lost that game Perhaps his most memorable international was the wartime game at Wembley on April when Scotland won and Shankly scored his only Scotland goal A post match report said that Scotland s success was inspired by the Busby Shankly victory service when Shankly and his future management rival Matt Busby combined to help Scotland s cause According to the Liverpool website Shankly s goal was probably the strangest national goal ever He took a speculative shot towards goal from yards and the ball bounced over the England goalkeeper s head and into the net In January when Shankly was the subject of This Is Your Life the goal was shown and Shankly commented that they all count and we won br br br Style and technique br Shankly declared in his autobiography that he specialised in what he called the art of tackling emphasising that it is an art He wrote that he was never sent off or booked by a referee In his view the art of tackling is in the timing and the sole object is to win the ball He wrote that even if the opponent is injured in the tackle it is not a foul if you have timed everything right and you have won the ball His philosophy therefore was to play hard but fair with no cheating During his playing career Shankly said he would not argue with referees He realised after taking the advice of his brothers that it is a waste of time The referee he wrote always wins in the end br Shankly was always noted for his dedication to football and in his playing days would do his own training during the summer months During the summer of when he returned to Glenbuck after completing his first season as a professional he decided to develop his throw in skills He was an early exponent of the long throw in he practised by throwing balls over a row of houses and the small boys of the village helped by fetching them back for him br br br Management career br Shankly wrote in his autobiography that he had long prepared himself for a career as a football manager He had absorbed all the coaching systems with any useful qualifications and had full confidence in his ability and in himself to be a leader For him he had done the hard work and it was simply a question of waiting for an opportunity to present itself Shankly summed up the essential criteria for success in football management when he claimed he could speak common sense about the game and could spot a good player In spotting a player he always applied a basic formula which was that first and foremost the player must have both ability and courage Other attributes were physical fitness and willingness to work especially to struggle against the odds br br br Carlisle United br Shankly began his managerial career at Carlisle United the club where his professional playing career had started Carlisle in the season were struggling in the bottom half of the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern based players because of the town s geographic remoteness in the far north of England Shankly s work ethic transformed the team who finished th in after he had been in charge for only the last few matches They improved to ninth in and then to third in almost gaining promotion br One of Shankly s players at Carlisle was Geoff Twentyman then a promising young centre half who was later transferred to Liverpool After he retired from playing Twentyman became chief scout at Liverpool working with Shankly and finding several outstandingly talented players br Shankly used psychology to motivate his players for example telling them that the opposition had had a very tiring journey and were not fit to play the match He urged the local population to support the team and would use the public address system at matches to tell the crowd about his team changes and how his strategy was improving the team Shankly recalled that Brunton Park was dilapidated writing that the main stand was falling to pieces and the terraces derelict He even burned all the kits When the team was travelling to Lincoln City he saw a sportswear shop in Doncaster and stopped the coach to buy a full set of kits in which the team played at Lincoln br Season ticket sales in reached an all time high and Carlisle challenged strongly for promotion as well as achieving a draw with Arsenal at Highbury in the FA Cup It ended badly however because Shankly accused the club s board of reneging on a bonus promise for the players should the team finish in the top three of the league He resigned and accepted an offer from Grimsby Town Shankly s overall record in league football at Carlisle was wins and defeats from matches br br br Grimsby Town br After an unsuccessful interview at Liverpool Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June He said in his autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons dropping from the First to the Third Division and some good players had been transferred before he arrived Even so Shankly believed he still had good players to work with and was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees br Grimsby made a strong challenge for promotion in but finished second three points behind Lincoln City only one team was promoted from Division Three North with one from Division Three South Shankly insisted in his autobiography that his Grimsby team was br br Pound for pound and class for class the best football team I have seen in England since the war In the league they were in they played football nobody else could play Everything was measured planned and perfected and you could not wish to see more entertaining football br Shankly s biographer Stephen Kelly quotes the pound for pound analysis but qualifies it as another of Shankly s slight though well meant exaggerations Kelly added that this kind of talk by Shankly could only boost morale at the club br Shankly made great use of five a side football in training at Grimsby playing these games as if they were competitive cup or league matches The games would last an hour each time Shankly worked on set pieces such as throw ins and tried to devise a method of counter attacking from corners conceded br Grimsby s ageing team made a bright start in with five straight wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place In Shankly became disillusioned when the board could not give him money to buy new players He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later and he finally resigned in January citing the board s lack of ambition as his main reason In his autobiography he said that he and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and when an opportunity came to manage Workington he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland Shankly s record in league football at Grimsby was wins and defeats from matches br br br Workington br Although the Workington team was close to the bottom of the Third Division North Shankly saw it as a challenge and attacked the job with all of his usual enthusiasm and relish Workington rose to th by the end of the season and so did not have to apply for re election In the team finished a creditable eighth and saw a rise in attendances from to br Workington operated on a shoestring and Shankly had to do much of the administration work himself including answering the telephone and dealing with the mail by using an old typewriter to answer letters In addition he had the risky job of going to the bank each week to collect the payroll One of his main problems was sharing the ground with the local rugby league club and Shankly was very concerned about the damage done to the playing surface by the rugby players The situation led to numerous arguments with the club s board which as Kelly records included a majority of rugby league men whose interest in football took second place to rugby br Shankly resigned on November to take up the post of assistant manager at Huddersfield Town working with his old friend Andy Beattie His record in league football at Workington was wins and defeats from matches br br br Huddersfield Town br Shankly s initial role at Huddersfield was as reserve team coach He found himself in charge of several promising youngsters who soon graduated to the first team after Town were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the season Beattie resigned in the next season and on November Shankly succeeded him as manager On Christmas Eve he gave a first team debut to year old prospect Denis Law Another prospect in his team was left back Ray Wilson who went on to become Huddersfield s most capped player before joining Everton Shankly did not gain promotion at Huddersfield the team finishing th in ninth in and th in br Other players in Shankly s Huddersfield team were Ken Taylor who was an England Test cricketer striker Les Massie and captain Bill McGarry On December Huddersfield lost to Charlton Athletic who played most of the match with ten men after Huddersfield were leading with just minutes remaining Shankly described it as one of the most amazing games he had ever seen On another occasion Huddersfield beat Liverpool with ten men and Shankly recalled the Liverpool directors leaving the ground in single file as if they were in a funeral procession br Disillusioned by a board that wanted to sell his best players without offering money to buy replacements Shankly felt stifled by Huddersfield s lack of ambition and was delighted in November to receive an approach for his services by Liverpool He recalled how Liverpool chairman Tom T V Williams asked him if he would like to manage the best club in the country to which Shankly replied Why is Matt Busby packing up Shankly decided to think about the offer as he realised the great potential at Liverpool who like Huddersfield were in the Second Division at that time Rumours began and were fuelled by Liverpool s visit to Leeds Road on November Although Huddersfield won the game Shankly accepted the Liverpool offer and resigned his position as Huddersfield manager at a board meeting on December His league record at Huddersfield was wins and defeats in matches br br br Liverpool br br br Early years br My idea was to build Liverpool into a bastion of invincibility Had Napoleon had that idea he would have conquered the bloody world My idea was to build Liverpool up and up until eventually everyone would have to submit and give in br When Shankly arrived at Anfield on Monday December Liverpool had been in the Second Division for five years and had been defeated by non league Worcester City in the FA Cup Anfield itself was in disrepair with no means of watering the pitch and Shankly insisted the club spend to rectify that Shankly described the training ground at Melwood as a shambles The Liverpool squad he inherited consisted largely of average players and some promising reserves br In spite of the difficulties Shankly quickly felt at home in his new club and believed he shared an immediate bond with the supporters whom he saw as his kind of people He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty to each other and to the club Paisley s influence at Liverpool was crucial for as Kelly puts it Shankly was the great motivating force behind Liverpool but it was Paisley who was the tactician One aspect of the quartet s legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the Boot Room which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff the playing staff were not so impressive indeed Shankly said of the latter br br After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough I made up my mind that we needed strengthening through the middle a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals and somebody up front to create goals and score them br To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad he placed players on the transfer list All of them had left the club within one year Shankly resolutely pursued his strength through the middle goal and always knew which three players he needed to achieve it br br Melwood was overgrown and had only an old wooden cricket pavilion Shankly commented that one of the pitches looked as if bombs had been dropped on it and he asked if the Germans had been over in the war He instituted a development programme to cultivate the site and modernise the facilities In the meantime he arranged for the players to meet and change at Anfield before going to and from Melwood by bus According to Kelly Liverpool s eventual success was based on hard work done in the training system that Shankly Paisley Fagan and Bennett introduced at Melwood Shankly deplored long distance running on roads and insisted that apart from warm up exercises or any special exercises needed to overcome injuries the players trained on grass using a ball Everything was done systematically with players rotating through exercise routines in groups with the purpose of achieving set targets These would first cycle through athletic exercises like skipping or squats before moving on to football specific functions such as a heading the ball or chipping it Five a side games as at all Shankly s earlier clubs were at the heart of the system and he again insisted on these being as competitive as league matches br One particular routine designed to develop stamina reflexes and ball skills was the sweat box which Shankly described as using boards like the walls of a house with players playing the ball off one wall and on to the next the ball was played against the boards you controlled it turned around and took it again Shankly got the idea from a routine he had seen Tom Finney use at Preston to hone his skills After experimenting with the routine he set the players a limit of two minutes per session The system was geared to Shankly s simple philosophy of pass and move which formed the basis of Liverpool s strategy Shankly insisted on suitable cooling off periods after training now called warming down before the players took a bath and had a meal The team changed the studs in their boots to suit all playing conditions Shankly summarised the entire strategy in terms of attention to detail with nothing left to chance br Liverpool s recovery depended on new players being acquired and in his autobiography Shankly recalled the struggles he had with the board to make them realise the club s potential and the need to spend money on good players He said there were times when he felt like walking out He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer of the Littlewoods pools organisation who joined the board not long after Shankly s appointment and shared Shankly s vision of Liverpool as the best club in England At one board meeting in when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland the board s initial response was that they couldn t afford them but Sawyer stepped in and said We can t afford not to buy them br The two Scottish players were centre half Ron Yeats and centre forward Ian St John from Dundee United and Motherwell respectively With Sawyer s help Shankly signed them both in the spring of and challenged the Liverpool board to sack him if they couldn t play At a press conference when Yeats came to Liverpool Shankly emphasised Yeats height by inviting the journalists to go and walk round him he s a colossus Goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence came through the club s junior teams so Shankly now had his strength through the middle and the team building continued with the acquisition of wing half Gordon Milne from Preston Other players developed at Anfield were Jimmy Melia Ronnie Moran Alan A Court and the future England internationals Gerry Byrne and Roger Hunt Shankly said of goalscorer Hunt the first time he saw him Christ this one can play Liverpool had finished third in both and only the top two clubs were promoted but the new team gained promotion in the season by winning the Second Division championship Hunt scoring goals br Liverpool consolidated in finishing eighth in their first top flight season under Shankly s management Significant signings were wing half Willie Stevenson from Rangers in and left winger Peter Thompson from Preston in Shankly described the Thompson deal as daylight robbery Liverpool s youth system produced more future England internationals in Ian Callaghan Tommy Smith and Chris Lawler The hard work paid off in when Liverpool won their sixth League Championship title ending the season with a defeat of Arsenal at Anfield According to Roger Hunt the secret of Liverpool s success was that under Shankly they were the fittest team in the country In Jimmy Melia was transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers with Shankly buying Arsenal s utility player Geoff Strong for and this was Liverpool s last significant transfer activity until br br br to br One of Shankly s greatest ambitions when he joined Liverpool was to win the FA Cup and after he signed Yeats and St John he told the club directors that they would win it with these two players in the team It was St John who scored the winning goal in May when Liverpool won the FA Cup for the first time in the club s history with a extra time victory over Leeds United at Wembley In his autobiography Shankly recounted that among his many achievements winning the FA Cup final was his greatest day in football Ahead of the final The Beatles had sent Shankly a telegram wishing the team luck and Shankly appeared on the BBC s Desert Island Discs where he picked the club s anthem You ll Never Walk Alone as his eighth and final selection br br The introduction of the all red strip had a huge psychological effect I went home that night and I said to my wife Ness You know something tonight I went out onto Anfield and for the first time there was a glow like a fire was burning Our game against Anderlecht was a night of milestones We wore the all red strip for the first time Christ the players looked like giants And we played like giants br Liverpool made their European debut in competing in the European Cup and reaching the semi finals In the second round the club was drawn against the formidable Anderlecht Immediately before the match Shankly decided to experiment with the Liverpool kit Liverpool played in red shirts with white shorts and white socks with red stripes but Shankly and Ian St John had the idea of an all red kit that would give the impression the players were taller Liverpool played in all red only for European matches but quickly adopted the colour permanently br Three days after winning the FA Cup Liverpool defeated European champions Inter Milan at Anfield in the semi final first leg with a performance that was saluted by Inter s coach Helenio Herrera The second leg at the San Siro remains controversial because according to Shankly the match was a war which Liverpool lost and so were knocked out of the competition on aggregate Eleven years later Shankly maintained that two of Inter s goals were illegal Even today the Liverpool website describes the match by saying that Liverpool were denied at the semi final stage by a dishonest referee in Milan According to Kelly however video evidence shows that the two disputed goals were actually legitimate Shankly said after the defeat in Milan that the Inter fans were going mad because they were so pleased to have beaten Liverpool and he insisted it proved the high standard to which the Liverpool team had raised itself In the Football League Championship Liverpool dropped from first to seventh with fewer points than the previous season perhaps due to the exertion of lengthy participation in the FA and European Cups br In Liverpool regained the League Championship title and reached the final of the European Cup Winners Cup at Hampden Park where they lost in extra time to Borussia Dortmund Shankly s summary of that final played on a wet night was that the team didn t play well and gave away two silly goals Shankly and Paisley had learned a great deal about European football which Liverpool would eventually turn into trophies Their strategy in two legged ties would be containment away and attack at home Shankly had applied the principle in a preliminary round tie against Juventus when Liverpool were away in the first leg Despite Juventus taking the lead after minutes Shankly ordered his players to ensure the deficit was only one goal Liverpool then switched to all out attack in the second leg at Anfield and won aggregate br Liverpool began the season by beating neighbours Everton in the FA Charity Shield match but the team were never really in contention for major honours that season finishing fifth in the league Shankly recognised the potential of Blackpool teenager Emlyn Hughes a future England captain and signed him for in February Liverpool s performance in the European Cup was poor and after struggling to overcome FC Petrolul Ploie ti in the first round they were well beaten in the last by Ajax Amsterdam inspired by year old Johan Cruyff Ajax won on aggregate after defeating Liverpool in Amsterdam Several years later in his autobiography Shankly still complained that the match in Amsterdam should never have started because of fog and although Liverpool lost he still thought Liverpool would win the tie at Anfield Although Shankly claimed to have been unworried about the Ajax defeat he acknowledged that he was examining the team and planning ahead The Liverpool site argues that Shankly was mistaken in his decision at this time to postpone team rebuilding br Liverpool improved their league performances over the next two years finishing third in and then second in although to Shankly himself it was a mediocre time in the late s as we prepared for the s Shankly made two controversial signings in this period which did not turn out as he had hoped In he signed striker Tony Hateley from Chelsea for a club record and then felt obliged to transfer him to Coventry City only a year later He wrote that bad luck and injuries disrupted the progress of two other prospects Alf Arrowsmith and Gordon Wallace Shankly had compared the latter to Tom Finney In September he paid equivalent to in to Wolverhampton Wanderers for their teenage striker Alun Evans who thus became football s first teenager Evans started well and produced some outstanding performances during his four years at the club but Shankly eventually had to sell him to Aston Villa He later recalled that Evans was scarred by a glass in a nightclub incident which in Shankly s opinion had a detrimental impact on his career br The only long term success that Shankly had in the transfer market in the late s was his signing of Emlyn Hughes who went on to captain Liverpool to victory in the European Cup Otherwise he did not significantly change the team until the season when Liverpool finished fifth in the league championship a long way behind the winners their local rivals Everton Shankly was characteristically defiant whenever Everton got the better of Liverpool and although he liked and respected everyone connected with Everton would always talk up Liverpool at Everton s expense Typical of this was his joke about the city having two great football teams Liverpool and Liverpool reserves br In the FA Cup quarter final Liverpool played against struggling Second Division side Watford at Vicarage Road and lost after a very poor performance The Liverpool site records that the defeat signalled the end for St John Hunt Byrne Yeats and Lawrence the incomers included Ray Clemence Alec Lindsay Larry Lloyd John Toshack Brian Hall and Steve Heighway Apart from Hall who graduated through the reserves they were all signed from clubs in lower divisions or even in the case of Heighway from non league football Adding the new players to Tommy Smith Ian Callaghan Chris Lawler and Emlyn Hughes Shankly formed the nucleus of a second great team which went on to dominate English and European football in the s br Many of the new players came to Liverpool because of a new scouting system created by Shankly in and placed under the control of new chief scout Geoff Twentyman who had played for Shankly at Carlisle and had then spent several seasons at Liverpool retiring shortly before Shankly s appointment According to Stephen Kelly hiring Twentyman as chief scout was perhaps Shankly s finest signing ever It was through Twentyman that Liverpool found the new players and after Shankly retired Twentyman gave sterling service to Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan by finding players including Phil Neal Alan Hansen and Ian Rush As always Shankly kept things simple and Twentyman was told to look for a prospect s basic qualities which were the abilities to pass the ball and move into position to receive a pass Shankly also wanted Twentyman to check the player s personality and ensure he had the right attitude for a professional footballer Above all said Twentyman he wanted to know if the lad had the heart to play for Liverpool Although Shankly sometimes paid large transfer fees he was loath to do so and Twentyman s brief was to find young players so he Shankly could mould them into what he wanted br br br to br The new team began promisingly in by retaining fifth place in the league and reaching the semi finals of the Inter Cities Fairs Cup where they lost to Leeds United side The highlight of Liverpool s European campaign that season was a aggregate victory in the quarter final over Bayern Munich For the first time since winning the competition in Liverpool reached the FA Cup Final but as in the Fairs Cup experience was the major factor and Shankly s young team were beaten by league champions Arsenal despite having taken the lead in extra time through a Steve Heighway goal Watching from the sidelines was another new player whom Shankly had recently signed from Scunthorpe United for on Twentyman s recommendation This was Kevin Keegan and he was such an important addition to the new Liverpool team that Shankly devoted an entire chapter of his autobiography to him entitled A Boy Called Keegan Shankly summarised Keegan as the inspiration of the new team br In Keegan s first season Liverpool missed out on winning the League Championship by a single point the title going to Brian Clough s Derby County Shankly maintained that Liverpool were denied a definite penalty in their crucial away match against Derby and then had a good goal disallowed towards the end of their final match against Arsenal Both decisions cost the team a vital point which would have been enough to claim first place Shankly took encouragement from the team s overall form especially as they made a strong finish to the season and he was confident of success in br br Shankly had always been noted for his use of psychology both to encourage his own players and to raise doubt in the minds of opponents One of his lasting innovations is the THIS IS ANFIELD plaque secured to the wall above the players tunnel Coupled with the roar of the crowd it was designed to intimidate Shankly stated the plaque is to remind our lads who they re playing for and to remind the opposition who they re playing against In the first match after it was erected Liverpool defeated Newcastle United on March despite an attempt by Malcolm Macdonald to joke about the sign Shankly would try to boost the confidence of his own players by announcing that a key opponent was unfit When Keegan was about to play against Bobby Moore for the first time Shankly told him that Moore had been out at a night club and was hung over Afterwards Keegan having produced an outstanding performance against the equally outstanding Moore Shankly told him that Moore had been brilliant that day and Keegan would never play against anyone better br In Liverpool won the club s eighth league title and their third under Shankly On December the team beat Crystal Palace at Anfield to make it consecutive home wins in the league This was the longest run in English top flight history until it was surpassed by J rgen Klopp s Liverpool who made it consecutive home wins in March A massive bonus for the club was winning the UEFA Cup the club s first European success In the two legged final they faced Borussia M nchengladbach whom Shankly rated the best team in Europe The first leg at Anfield had to be played twice after an abandonment due to heavy rain which flooded the pitch Shankly had left John Toshack out of the team but then having studied the Borussia defence recalled him for the rematch the following night Toshack used his height and heading ability to great effect and created two goals for Keegan as Liverpool won The second leg in M nchengladbach was a different story as Borussia took an early lead and Shankly admitted he thought the final was lost but Liverpool held on to win the final by an aggregate score of It was the first time an English club had won both the league title and a European trophy in the same season br Liverpool were well beaten by Red Star Belgrade in the second round of the European Cup and lost out to Leeds in the League Championship finishing second In the third round of the FA Cup Liverpool had to score a late equaliser to draw at home against lowly Doncaster Rovers but recovered to win the replay and then go all the way to the final In what proved to be Shankly s last competitive game in charge Liverpool produced a superb second half performance to defeat Newcastle at Wembley br br br Relationship with fans br br In his autobiography Shankly wrote Right from the start as a manager i e when he was at Carlisle I tried to show that the fans are the people that matter You ve got to know how to treat them and have them on your side This was particularly true at Liverpool and Shankly said he was made for Liverpool where the people that matter most are the ones who come through the turnstiles He added that a manager has got to identify himself with the people because their team is something that really matters to them In return he said the support of the Liverpool fans for their team had been incredible br In April when Shankly and the team were showing off the League Championship trophy to the fans on the Kop he saw a policeman fling aside a Liverpool scarf which had been thrown in Shankly s direction Shankly retrieved the scarf and wore it He said to the policeman Don t you do that That s precious Shankly saw the offer of the scarf as a mark of respect which deserved his respect in return br Shankly emphasised the importance of communication with the supporters At Carlisle he used to speak to them over the public address system before matches Rather than just putting a few lines in the match programme he preferred to speak and explain his team changes and his views about the previous match At Workington he would answer supporters letters in person using an old typewriter He said he preferred to phone business people as he would put as little as possible in writing when dealing with them He would readily obtain match tickets for fans whom he considered to be deserving cases and wrote in his autobiography that he would give people anything within reason br Shankly formed a special bond with the Liverpool supporters and at the end of the season when Liverpool won the Second Division championship he told the Liverpool Echo In all sincerity I can say that they are the greatest crowd of supporters in the game In Tommy Smith s view Shankly was completely in tune with the city of Liverpool he loved the supporters and they loved him mainly because they knew he understood them br br Liverpool is not only a club It s an institution And my aim was to bring the people close to the club and the team and for them to be accepted part of it The effect was that wives brought their late husband s ashes to Anfield and scattered them on the pitch after saying a little prayer I said to them In you come you re welcome and they trotted in by the dozen One young boy got killed at his work and a bus load of people came to Anfield one Sunday to scatter his ashes at the Kop end So people not only support Liverpool when they re alive They support them when they are dead This is the true story of Liverpool This is possibly why Liverpool are so great There is no hypocrisy about it It is sheer honesty br Regarded as a great orator who stirred emotions among the fanbase following the FA Cup Final which Liverpool lost to Arsenal Shankly and the players toured the city of Liverpool where people turned out to greet the gallant losers Standing on the steps of St George s Hall Shankly overlooked a crowd of over Liverpool fans and delivered one of his most famous speeches Since I ve come here to Liverpool to Anfield I ve drummed it into our players time and again that they are privileged to play for you And if they didn t believe me they believe me now Commenting on the mood of the crowd a moved Peter Robinson club secretary of Liverpool told a reporter Bill s got such power of oratory that if he told them to march through the Mersey tunnel and pillage Birkenhead they d do it br br br Retirement from Liverpool br Shankly was when Liverpool won the FA Cup final and said in his autobiography that on returning to the dressing room at the end of the match he felt tired from all the years His mind was made up and he knew he was going to retire His wife Nessie had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time Tommy Smith said that Shankly s feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision In he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret which was that he did not win the European Cup br Shankly had considered retirement in previous years The Liverpool secretary Peter Robinson was initially blas in but when he realised Shankly was serious this time tried to make him change his mind Shankly s granddaughter Karen Gill said to The Observer in I think that perhaps it was tiredness that football had taken its toll on him In her book about her grandfather Karen Gill said Shankly never professed anything privately about retirement that he did not declare publicly She did not agree that there was any hidden motive behind his decision and she thought Brian Clough s view about tiredness was probably correct br Shankly s retirement was officially and surprisingly announced at a press conference called by Liverpool on July Chairman John Smith said in his opening address br br It is with great regret that I as chairman of Liverpool Football Club have to inform you that Mr Shankly has intimated that he wishes to retire from active participation in league football And the board has with extreme reluctance accepted his decision I would like to at this stage place on record the board s great appreciation of Mr Shankly s magnificent achievements over the period of his managership br Shankly soon regretted his decision and tried to continue his involvement with the club mainly by turning up for team training at Melwood He said he still wanted the involvement as the club had become his life He soon stopped going to Melwood because he felt there was some resentment and people were asking what he was doing there He still attended matches but sat in the stand away from the directors and staff He was especially annoyed that Liverpool did not invite him to attend away matches as the club s guest When finally he was invited to travel with them to the away leg of the UEFA Cup Final in Bruges he was accommodated in a separate hotel and said he found that insulting Shankly contrasted Liverpool s attitude with what he encountered at other clubs including Liverpool s great rivals Everton and Manchester United where he was received warmly He recalled Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty s comment to a Liverpool director that he Shankly was welcome at Old Trafford About Everton once his greatest rivals he wrote that he had been received more warmly by Everton than by Liverpool He said it was a scandal that he needed to say that about the club he had helped to build br From Liverpool s point of view the situation was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley s status as manager On one visit to Melwood a player opined to Shankly that Paisley had made a good start in the job Shankly retorted I could have left a monkey in charge Shankly s visits even went as far as actually taking over the training Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley Fagan and Bennett about what needed to be done As a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley s initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment Eventually Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he did not work there any more that it was now Paisley s team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team br It is believed that Shankly wanted a seat on the Liverpool board as Matt Busby had been given by Manchester United after he retired as their manager in Again what Shankly did not understand was that his relations with the board had often been acrimonious with several resignation threats and a statement made by Shankly that br br At a football club there s a holy trinity the players the manager and the supporters Directors don t come into it They are only there to sign the cheques br Although some club officials like secretary Peter Robinson wanted bygones to be bygones Tommy Smith summarised the board s view as one of satisfaction that Shankly had gone at last There was a perception that Shankly was an overbearing figure who could use a position on the board to be a back seat driver and the board were well aware that Matt Busby s time as a Manchester United director had been disastrous Busby s successors had complained about being undermined by his continued presence at United who had been relegated in While Liverpool s treatment of Shankly may have seemed disrespectful they were acting in the best interests of the club and its new manager by pursuing the same relentless winning ethic that Shankly himself had instilled In any event their perceived ruthlessness was vindicated by the unprecedented haul of League Championship titles and European Cups won over the next decade under Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan br Soon after Shankly s retirement Brian Clough who himself had recently been sacked by Leeds United was asked during a David Frost interview whom in football management he respected to which Clough replied Well the guy who had my total respect finished a few months ago at Liverpool He s a one off there ll never be another one like Shanks Never at all He absolutely lives the game he was totally honest he believed implicitly in what he was doing and there was never ever a doubt when you either talked to him met him or anything he was above board He was above board He was one off br br br Later years br br Shankly was awarded the OBE in November four months after he retired as Liverpool manager He and Nessie went to Buckingham Palace and according to Kelly that was a rare day out for them They continued to live in the semi detached house at West Derby near the Everton training ground at Bellefield which they bought when they moved to Liverpool in After Shankly s death in Nessie lived there alone until she died in August br Shankly tried to keep busy in retirement and stay in touch with football He worked for Radio City a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson and was a pundit on its football coverage He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter In November the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County but the position went to Colin Murphy instead John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in Despite being in his sixties Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five a side football If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts br br br Death and legacy br On the morning of September Bill Shankly was admitted to Broadgreen Hospital following a heart attack His condition appeared to be stable and there was no suggestion that his life was in danger On the following Monday morning his condition suddenly deteriorated and he was transferred into intensive care At on September he suffered another cardiac arrest and was certified dead twenty seven days after his th birthday at He was cremated at the Anfield Crematorium on October and his ashes were scattered on the Anfield pitch at the Kop end br br On the day of Shankly s death training was cancelled at both Melwood and Bellefield The Labour Party conference stood in a minute s silence for a man who had always been a socialist Sir Matt Busby the former Manchester United manager was so upset that he refused to take any telephone calls from people asking him for a reaction Tributes poured in from the world of football especially from the former players of all Shankly s clubs Liverpool chairman John Smith summed them up with a simple but fitting In my opinion he was the most outstanding and dynamic manager of the century On October Liverpool s first home league game since his passing Anfield celebrated his life with one fan on the Kop holding aloft a homemade banner declaring Shankly Lives Forever br Liverpool erected the foot high cast iron Shankly Gates in front of the Anfield Road stand Inscribed You ll Never Walk Alone they were opened by Nessie Shankly at a low key ceremony in August In a seven foot tall bronze statue of Shankly was unveiled outside the stadium It bears the legend He made the people happy In a plinth to Shankly was installed on Avenue outside Anfield The inscription features details of Liverpool s win over Inter Milan at Anfield the club s first great European night br From the mid s Preston North End started a complete re building of Deepdale to convert it into a modern all seater stadium When the former Spion Kop end was replaced by a new stand in it was named the Bill Shankly Kop and was designed with different coloured seats providing an image of Shankly s head and shoulders br Shankly was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame in in recognition of his impact on the English game as a manager In he was an inaugural inductee into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame David Peace s biographical novel Red or Dead published in is a fictionalised account of Shankly s career as Liverpool manager The novel was short listed for the inaugural Goldsmiths Prize A hotel and museum opened in Liverpool in August dedicated to the life and career of Bill Shankly Shankly also features in the popular Liverpool chant Allez Allez Allez which is frequently sung by Liverpool supporters especially during European matches Archived voice overs of Shankly My idea was to build Liverpool into a bastion of invincibility appear on the track Anfield Rap a Liverpool FA Cup Final song from br br The club was unrecognisable from the decrepit rundown place it had been on the eve of the s Shankly found a team mired in the second tier of English football and propelled them to the continent s top table He led the side to three titles delivered their first FA Cup and their first European trophy the Uefa Cup Yet the silverware tells only a fraction of the story The man from Glenbuck s biggest impact was metaphysical He created the idea of Liverpool something that did not exist before his arrival on Merseyside That concept still runs through the club Shankly made a point of emphasising the importance of fans He talked about the Kop sucking the ball into the net and made spectators feel like participants in games Shankly is the most significant icon in the club s history br br br Personal life br Shankly was married to his wife Agnes Wren Fisher from until his death years later They had met earlier during World War II when Bill was serving as a Corporal with the RAF and Nessie who was six years younger was serving with the WRAF They had two daughters Barbara born and Jeanette born and eventually went on to have six grandchildren although their youngest grandchild and only grandson was born several months after Bill Shankly s death Nessie survived her husband by more than years dying in August at the age of On Shankly s appointment as Liverpool manager in he and his family moved into a house in Bellefield Avenue West Derby Liverpool Nessie Shankly was still living there at the time of her death more than years later br Upon his death in Shankly left in his will equivalent to in br br br Personality br br Stephen Kelly in his biography of Shankly calls him the ultimate obsessive Shankly was fanatical about Liverpool and about football in general From coaching his players and arguing with journalists to buttonholing fans in pubs all Shankly ever wanted to do was talk about football and to be involved in football As a result he had few interests outside the game other than his family His wife Nessie told Kelly that Shankly would spend time in the garden mowing and weeding She could rely on him to clean the cooker when Liverpool lost Family holidays were limited to a week in Blackpool where they always stayed at the Norbreck Hotel One non football activity that Shankly did enjoy was playing cards and Ian St John said he loved it always taking part on long coach trips to away matches br Shankly was noted for his charismatic personality and his wit as a result he is oft quoted His most famous quotation is probably one that is often paraphrased br br Some people believe football is a matter of life and death I am very disappointed with that attitude I can assure you it is much much more important than that br Kelly wrote that although it was said half jokingly so far as Shankly was concerned there was a degree of truth in what he had said Shankly had fully realised the importance of football to its die hard fans himself included It had become too important Ian St John agreed that much of Shankly s behaviour was bizarre but everything was done with a purpose because Shankly always knew what he was doing and what he was saying br br It s the greatest thing in the world natural enthusiasm You re nothing without it br On how his tough working class upbringing kept him grounded Pressure is working down the pit Pressure is having no work at all Pressure is trying to escape relegation on shillings a week Pressure is not the European Cup or the Championship or the Cup Final That s the reward On his belief in hard work he referred to his time in the RAF If I had a job to do even if it was scrubbing the floor I wanted my floor to be cleaner than yours Now if everyone thinks along these lines and does all the small jobs to the best of their ability that s honesty then the world would be better and football will be better So what I want is hard work And no football club is successful without hard work br In his autobiography Shankly gave insights into his character such as his world view as a socialist explaining that the socialism he believed in was not about politics but about collectivism with everyone working for each other and enjoying a share of the rewards That was the basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares the rewards br While he lived most of his life in the North of England Shankly identified as a Scot saying If Scotland went to war tomorrow I ll be the first one there He admitted to idolising Robert Burns whose birthplace was only miles from Glenbuck and he was inspired by many of Burns philosophical quotations such as his egalitarian statement that A Man s A Man for A That Shankly had no time for bigotry or prejudice especially arising from differences of religion He compared the cities of Glasgow and Liverpool by saying that there is nothing like the Rangers Celtic situation in Liverpool because the supporters of Liverpool and Everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football br Shankly s public persona was that of a tough guy with the swagger of his favourite film star James Cagney but privately he was very different Joe Mercer described his heart of gold and likened him to a Border Collie who drives his sheep but could never hurt them Liverpool s perceived failings in the late s have been attributed to Shankly s reluctance to drop his long serving players even though they were past their best Bob Paisley said it was Shankly s one failing and it was because he was a softie at heart br br When asked by a TV interviewer how he would like to be remembered Shankly replied Basically as an honest man in a game that is sometimes short on honesty That I ve been working honestly
