abandoned the SVV and continued as Dordrecht Van Zoghel remained as head coach and led the club to the Eerste Divisie championship at the end of the season with automatic promotion Again the Eredivisie was too big of a mouthful for the Dordrecht team who again relegated directly Chairman Cees den Braven resigned from the position and handed over the leadership of the club to former referee Frans Derks Much success was not achieved in the following years and the club slowly fell to the lower echelons of the Eerste Divisie A small revival occurred at the end of the season as

initiated Partly due to the disappointing financial results the budget for players decreased to thousand FC Dordrecht then began a partnership with Eredivisie club ADO Den Haag who provided players on

such as Alvin Daniels Jeroen Lumu and Jafar Arias but experience was also gained in the form of Geert Arend Roorda br br br Eerste Divisie since br Back in the Eerste Divisie for the season the club finished in a disappointing th place The following season a whole new squad was put together after the departure of many players Halfway through the season it became clear that it could be an even more disappointing year than the last Dordrecht was at the bottom of the league and faced the risk of relegation to the third tier Tweede Divisie as this was possible in the season unlike before Just before the end of the season there was a matchup between the bottom two clubs in Achilles and Dordrecht which ended in a draw leaving the latter in th place and safe from relegation Achilles were later deducted points were for their financial problems so that Dordrecht was finally safe and could continue their professional football operations br A large number of players were signed again ahead of the season and it soon became apparent that Dordrecht would bounce back from a disappointing previous season The club did not play well in the first half of the season but after the winter break the team accomplished a strong winning streak This ensured that Dordrecht became period champion on March after a win over RKC Waalwijk Thereby the club qualified for the promotion play offs for the Eredivisie In the play offs Dordrecht faced SC Cambuur in the first round In the home game they lost loss but in the return Dordrecht put down a strong performance and ended up winning in Leeuwarden to eventually advance after the penalty shootout Sparta Rotterdam awaited in the semi finals of the play offs The first game at home was lost and in the return match at Het Kasteel Dordrecht were up in the first half enough to reach the final but lost their lead in the second half as the match ended This ended their promotion run and Dordrecht remained in the second tier br The club introduced a new policy of signing players on longer contracts ahead of the season which meant that other clubs would have to put down larger transfer fees to convince Dordrecht to sell However like the previous season Dordrecht started the competition poorly and were in last place in mid November As a result head coach G rard de Nooijer was fired After assistant Scott Calderwood took over as caretaker until the winter break and subsequently left the club Cl udio Braga was appointed the new head coach Dordrecht also entered into partnerships with Feyenoord and English club Norwich City
