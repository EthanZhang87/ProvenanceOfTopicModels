Anything Goes and Kiss Me Kate were all seen during the decade In NBC had broadcast the Broadway musical Peter Pan starring Mary Martin It was a hit and the network looked for more family oriented musical projects Richard Rodgers had previously supplied the Emmy Award winning score for Victory at Sea a documentary series about World War II NBC approached Rodgers and Hammerstein and asked them to write an original musical expressly for television rather than merely adapting an existing one to the television special format then a novel idea The team decided to adapt the fairy tale Cinderella and new to television they sought the advice of an industry insider Richard Lewine Lewine was then the Vice President in charge of color television at CBS and a cousin of Richard Rodgers He told Rodgers and Hammerstein that CBS was also seeking a musical project and had already signed Julie Andrews who was then starring in My Fair Lady on Broadway Rodgers recalled in his autobiography What sold us immediately was the chance to work with Julie Rodgers and Hammerstein signed with CBS br Rodgers and Hammerstein retained ownership of the show and had control over casting direction set and costumes while CBS controlled the technical aspects of the broadcast and had an option for a second broadcast CBS announced the production on September In adapting the famous fairy tale Rodgers and Hammerstein stayed faithful to the original Charles Perrault version Hammerstein was interviewed by the Saturday Review about the adaptation We want the kids who see it to recognize the story they know Children can be very critical on that score But of course their parents will be watching too so we have tried to humanize the characters without altering the familiar plot structure The musical had to fit into the minute program with six commercial breaks so it was divided into six short acts In an interview with Time magazine Hammerstein said that It took me seven months to write the book and lyrics for Cinderella br Rehearsals started on February Emmy Award winning director Ralph Nelson and choreographer Jonathan Lucas who had choreographed for The Milton Berle Show were both

mixed with most critics praising Osnes s performance br Keke Palmer was a replacement in the title role A report in The Guardian commented that casting an African American actor as such an iconic and

international productions have followed br br The version of Cinderella was seen by the largest audience in history at the time of its premiere people in the US fully of the country s population at that time Variety estimated that million households were tuned into the show with an average of viewers each Jon Cypher later remembered leaving the studio a few minutes after the broadcast had ended and finding the Manhattan streets deserted because so many had stayed in to watch the broadcast br A review in The New York Times by Jack Gould characterized the musical as a pleasant Cinderella that lacked the magic touch He wrote that the broadcast received an extraordinary range of reactions it was either unreservedly enjoyed rather angrily rejected or generally approved subject to significant reservations He praised Andrews as a beguiling vision in lovely color video But he complained about the book What possessed Mr Hammerstein to turn the stepsisters into distasteful vaudeville clowns about errors in the most elementary kind of showmanship about costume couldn t Cinderella have been dressed in a dreamlike ball gown of fantasy rather than a chic form fitting number and the staging cramped excellent depth but limited width marred the ballroom scene He judged the songs not top drawer Rodgers and Hammerstein and reminiscent and derivative of some of their earlier successes but praised four of them and said In television where original music is virtually nonexistent these add up to quite a treat some current Broadway musicals cannot boast as much melodically br The version was broadcast repeatedly The production was the number one show of the week with over million viewers It became the highest rated TV musical in a generation Although it was a hit with audiences it received mixed reviews Theater historian John Kenrick called it a clumsy remake of the musical but commented that Bernadette Peters shtick trying on the glass slipper is hilarious The New York Times praised the performers Montalban has an old fashioned luxurious voice Jason Alexander provides comic relief Goldberg winningly blends royal dignity with motherly meddling Peters brings vigor and sly comedy but commented that the musical was always a pumpkin that never turned into a glittering coach the songs are lesser Rodgers and Hammerstein it doesn t take that final leap into pure magic Often charming and sometimes ordinary this is a cobbled together Cinderella for the moment not the ages Other critics however praised the presentation One reviewer wrote Grade A a version both timely and timeless Another agreed this version has much to recommend it An encore broadcast on Valentine s Night drew another viewers br Reviews for the Broadway version were mixed Ben Brantley of The New York Times called the Broadway production a glittery patchwork of a show that wants to be reassuringly old fashioned and refreshingly irreverent sentimental and snarky sincere and ironic all at once Brantley felt that the show doesn t seem to know quite what it wants to be The Financial Times praised the cast especially Osnes the costumes and the choreography and opined that the production is an absolute joy marred only by occasional slowness of pace Richard Zoglin writing for Time magazine noted that the new production is brightly colored high spirited and well sung but compared it unfavorably with the emotionally alive broadcast A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune wrote The fundamental problem with Beane s perplexing wholly unromantic and mostly laugh free new book is that it denies the audience the pleasure of instant reversals of fortune This new version ends up collapsing the basic logic of the familiar story and tramples all over the musical soul of a score from another era On the other hand the reviewer from USA Today liked the production commenting that Osnes and a gifted supporting cast make this fairy tale very much their own a scrumptious trifle that for all its hokey moments will charm theatergoers of all ages An Associated Press review praised Beane s script and wrote that it crackles with sweetness and freshness combining a little Monty Python s Spamalot with some Les Mis rables It also found the cast first rate and the overall story quirky yet heart filled br br Columbia Records recorded the musical selections from the first telecast of Cinderella on March nearly two weeks before the show aired in monaural and stereophonic sound releasing the mono version in and then the stereo version in The stereo version was later reissued on CD
