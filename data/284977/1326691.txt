title: Edelweiss (song)
id: 1326691
 Edelweiss is a show tune from the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Sound of Music It is named after the edelweiss Leontopodium nivale a white flower found high in the Alps The song was created for the Broadway production of The Sound of Music as a song for the character Captain Georg von Trapp In the musical Captain von Trapp and his family sing this song during the concert near the end of Act II It is a statement of Austrian patriotism in the face of the pressure put upon him to join the navy of Nazi Germany following the Anschluss Nazi annexation of their homeland It is also Captain von Trapp s subliminal goodbye to his beloved homeland using the flower as a symbol of his loyalty to Austria In the film adaptation the song is also sung by the Captain earlier in the film when he rediscovers music with his children br This was the final song of Rodgers and Hammerstein s musical collaboration as well as the last song written by Oscar Hammerstein II who died in August br br br Writing br While The Sound of Music was in tryouts in Boston Richard Rodgers felt Captain von Trapp should have a song with which he would bid farewell to the Austria he knew and loved Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II decided to write an extra song that von Trapp would sing in the festival concert sequence towards the end of the show As they were writing it they felt this song could also use the guitar playing and folk singing talents of Theodore Bikel who had been cast as the Captain The Lindsay and Crouse script provides the metaphor of the simple edelweiss wildflower as a symbol of the Austria that Captain von Trapp Maria and their children knew would live on in their hearts despite the Nazi annexation of their homeland The metaphor of this song builds on an earlier scene when Gretl presents a bouquet of edelweiss flowers to Baroness Elsa Schr der during the latter s visit to the von Trapp household br Rodgers provided a simple yet haunting and affecting waltz time melody to the simple Italian style ritornello lyric that Hammerstein wrote about the appearance of the edelweiss flower Edelweiss turned out to be one of the most beloved songs in the musical as well as one of the best loved songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein br Edelweiss is the last song Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote together Hammerstein was suffering from stomach cancer which took his life nine months after The Sound of Music opened on Broadway br br br Film adaptation br Although the stage production uses the song only during the concert sequence Ernest Lehman s screenplay for the film adaptation uses the song twice Lehman created a scene that makes extra use of the song This scene inspired by a line in the original script by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse calls for Captain von Trapp to sing Edelweiss with his children in their family drawing room and rediscover the love he felt for them with Liesl accompanying him Lehman also expanded the scope of the song when it was sung in the Salzburg Festival concert scene so that Captain von Trapp and his family would call on the crowds to join in the song with him in defiance of the Nazi soldiers posted around the arena br Christopher Plummer played the part of Captain von Trapp in the film adaptation However his singing was overdubbed with the voice of Bill Lee despite Plummer recording the song himself br An instrumental version of the song is also heard as the final song played during the party as Maria leaves to return to the abbey at the end of the first half of the film br br br Austrian attitudes br The edelweiss is a popular flower in Austria and was featured on the old Austrian schilling coin It can also now be seen on the cent Euro coin The flower is protected in Austria and illegal to pick An edelweiss is also worn as a cap emblem by certain Austrian Army and the German Gebirgsj ger mountain troopers units stationed in the nearby Bavarian Alps br In the original run the musical The Sound of Music was treated with disdain by Austrians and the song Edelweiss has been singled out for criticism When US President Ronald Reagan quoted the song in to toast Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschl ger Austrian newspapers complained that the song was full of clich s and called it kitsch When the musical premiered on the national stage in Vienna in one critic called it boring and another referred to Edelweiss as an insult to Austrian musical creation However attitudes have improved as film tourism became a bigger attraction than Salzburg s attraction for being the birthplace of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart When the musical premiered in Salzburg in most performances were sold out br br br Misconceptions br The great popularity of the song has led many of its audience to believe that it is an Austrian folk song or even the official national anthem However Austria s official anthem is Land der Berge Land am Strome and the anthem used from until the Anschluss was Sei gesegnet ohne Ende br There is similar confusion about another song co authored by Hammerstein Ol Man River from the musical Show Boat which is widely though erroneously believed to be an African American spiritual The similarity between the misconceptions about the two songs has been noted by two writers both of whom see it as testament to Hammerstein s talents Alyson McLamore in her book Musical Theater An Appreciation writes The last song to be written for the show was Edelweiss a tender little homage to a native flower of Austria that has the effect of authentic Austrian folksong much as Ol Man River struck listeners as a genuine African American spiritual Hugh Fordin in his biography of Oscar Hammerstein writes about the ability of the authors to simulate the quality of an authentic folk song Ol Man River had the ring of a black laborer s song Thirty years later Edelweiss was widely believed to be an old Austrian song though Oscar composed it for the Sound of Music br Theodore Bikel in his autobiography Theo wrote that after a performance he was once approached by a native Austrian who said I love that Edelweiss and then added with total confidence Of course I have known it for a long time but only in German br Another misconception about the song is that it is a real life Nazi anthem even though Edelweiss is not a pro Nazi song within the context of The Sound of Music nor did the song even exist during the Nazi era There is however another song Es war ein Edelweiss which was indeed composed by Herms Niel for the German Army in br br br Legal problems br The estates of Rodgers and Hammerstein have not authorized the use of alternative lyrics with the melody of the song making certain commercial uses of those versions potentially infringing if they do not fall under fair use Rodgers stated that he would take legal action against any group using the Edelweiss melody with altered words the current rightsholders comply with his wishes refusing to grant permission for these commercial requests which are inconsistent with the creators intentions br br br Other versions br English singer Vince Hill reached in the UK Singles Chart in with his cover version of the track br Josephine Siao performed a Chinese Cantonese version in the movie Lightning Killer br In American country singer Carrie Underwood and English actor Stephen Moyer along with Ariane Rinehart Michael Nigro Ella Watts Gorman Joe West Sophia Caruso Grace Rundhaug and Peyton Ella would perform the song in The Sound of Music Live and would do a studio recording of the song for the soundtrack br A performance by Jeanette Olsson is used in the opening sequence of the Amazon series The Man in the High Castle br br br
