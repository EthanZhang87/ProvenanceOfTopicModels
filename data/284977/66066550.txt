album Folklore and released it the next day Produced by herself first time collaborator Aaron Dessner long time collaborator Jack Antonoff and then boyfriend Joe Alwyn the album was a critical and commercial success becoming the best selling album of and winning Album of the Year at the rd Annual Grammy Awards On November a concert documentary titled Folklore The Long Pond Studio Sessions shot at Dessner s Long Pond Studio in Hudson Valley was released to Disney It detailed the making of Folklore with performances of its songs br After releasing Folklore Swift continued to work remotely with Dessner who would send her instrumental tracks to which she would write the lyrics She stated the rave reception of Folklore further encouraged her to experiment further with its musical style Soon after Swift s sessions with Dessner resulted in a project that was a natural extension of Folklore which eventually assumed its individual identity as Evermore Dessner dubbed Evermore a weird avalanche effecting from Folklore In comparison to its predecessor the development of Evermore was a more experimental process during which the duo did not subject themselves to any limitations In an Apple Music interview to Zane Lowe Swift stated Evermore gave her a feeling of quiet conclusion and sort of this weird serenity after putting out Folklore and correlated it with the themes of those albums saying one of Folklore s main tropes was conflict resolution trying to figure out how to get through something with someone whereas Evermore deals with endings of all sorts sizes and shapes and the pain and various phases of those closures br On December three days prior to her st birthday Swift posted nine photos on Instagram which together formed an image depicting the singer s back with her hair in a braid and facing a forest In another post across her social media she announced her ninth studio album titled Evermore releasing at midnight She revealed the track list and a music video for its opening track Willow which would premiere on YouTube alongside the album release Referring to lockdown regulations in light of the COVID pandemic Swift wrote You ve all been so caring supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I thought I would give you something I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us and if there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do this is for you Prior to the Willow music video premiere Swift said she likens Evermore to fall and winter in contrast to its predecessor s spring and summer br br br Writing and recording br Like its predecessor Evermore is also a product of remote collaboration and virtual communication and was recorded in total secrecy Dessner produced or co produced all of the tracks except Gold Rush which Swift and Antonoff produced All of the tracks except Cowboy Like Me were recorded at Long Pond Studio where Folklore The Long Pond Studio Sessions was shot br After the release of Folklore Swift wrote two songs Closure and Dorothea for Big Red Machine which is a supergroup by Dessner and Justin Vernon the frontman of American indie folk band Bon Iver the songs ended up on Evermore instead To celebrate Folklore Dessner casually composed an instrumental track Westerly named after the location of Swift s Rhode Island home An hour later Swift wrote Willow to the track and sent it back to him She wrote the title track Evermore with Alwyn alias William Bowery and sent it to Vernon who added a bridge Dessner realized they were creating a counterpart to Folklore only after the duo wrote more than seven songs He composed Tolerate It on a piano in time signature and sent it to Swift conjuring a scene in her mind upon hearing the track she sent it back with finished lyrics Dessner stated he cried when he first heard its lyrics br Swift traveled to Long Pond Studio to film Folklore The Long Pond Studio Sessions Once filming was complete Swift stayed at Long Pond overnight to record with Dessner and Antonoff The next morning she approached Dessner in his kitchen with Tis the Damn Season which she wrote during the night Dessner cited the song as one of his favorite works ever and that it could have just remained as an instrumental but instead Swift s incredible storytelling ability and musical ability took it and made something much great No Body No Crime was inspired by Swift s obsession with true crime podcasts documentaries She wrote the song on a rubber bridge guitar and mailed Dessner a voice memo after which he started producing it Swift had specific ideas on how she wanted the song including a guest feature from American pop rock band Haim who recorded their vocals at Ariel Rechtshaid s Los Angeles home and forwarded it to Swift The song s harmonica and guitar riffs were played by Josh Kaufman who also played the harmonica on Betty from Folklore JT Bates played the drums and also did the same on Dorothea br br Aaron Dessner and his twin brother Bryce Dessner sent Swift some of the instrumentals they made for their band American indie rock band the National One of those was what would become Coney Island Swift and Alwyn wrote its lyrics and recorded it with her vocals After listening to the demo the Dessner brothers felt that the song was very related to the National and envisioned Matt Berninger the band s lead vocalist singing it and Bryan Devendorf the drummer drumming it Aaron Dessner informed Berninger who was excited about the idea The band assembled Devendorf played the drums while his brother Scott Devendorf played the bass and pocket piano Bryce Dessner helped produce the song br Marjorie was an instrumental precursor to Peace the fifteenth track on Folklore The latter s drone is present in the former s bridge The backing rhythm of Marjorie was composed with an Allovers Hi hat Generator a software developed by producer Ryan Olson which had been used in many Big Red Machine songs The instrument takes any sound and splits them into samples and regenerates them in randomized musical patterns Dessner went through the patterns picked his favorite parts looped them developed them into an instrumental and sent it to Swift who wrote Marjorie to it a song about her maternal grandmother and opera singer Marjorie Finlay She also sent a folder of Finlay s opera records to Dessner who sampled some of it on the song Right Where You Left Me and Happiness were written days before Evermore was finished Dessner had been working on the composition of Happiness since thinking it would be a Big Red Machine song Swift however admired its instrumentals and ended up finishing its lyrics which was also the case with Right Where You Left Me The last few weeks of recording Evermore overlapped with the recording of Fearless Taylor s Version Swift s first re recorded album she recorded Happiness and You Belong with Me Taylor s Version on the same day br Vernon was more involved in Evermore than Folklore He played the drums on Cowboy like Me and Closure guitar and banjo on Ivy and contributed backing vocals in Marjorie For Closure he processed Swift s vocals through his Messina vocal modifier which distorted her soft timbre into a robotic growl Cowboy like Me was recorded at Scarlet Pimpernel Studios located in the UK owned by Marcus Mumford the lead singer of English folk rock band Mumford Sons Mumford provided backing vocals on the song In Ivy Dessner added sleigh bells to invoke winter oriented emotions coinciding with the song s wintry imagery He intentionally added a wintry nostalgia to most of the music in Evermore leaning towards the idea Swift told him Dessner said mixing the album s songs was a Herculean task and that the sound engineer Jon Low thought it would not be finished on time br br br Music and lyrics br br The standard edition of Evermore is one hour long consisting of tracks while the deluxe adds two bonus songs Haim the National and Bon Iver provide guest vocals on No Body No Crime Coney Island and Evermore respectively Critics have dubbed Evermore a sequel and a companion record to Folklore br br br Composition br Evermore is an indie folk folk pop alternative rock and chamber rock record with country influences It has its predecessor s minimal and lo fi styles but looser and more experimental in nature The album is characterized by its acoustic core and wintry mood consisting of sparse arrangements slow burning melodies burbling fingerpicked acoustic guitars swaying electric guitars soft smooth and somber pianos warm and woozy synthesizers mandolin twangy banjos throbbing drum machines lush strings electronic thrums subtle layers of Mellotrons flute French horn and cellos Swift s mellifluous vocals are backed by gauzy harmonies and misty atmospherics br Rolling Stone wrote that Evermore deepens Swift s goth folk vision Hits described the album s sonic palette as watery and hypnotic The Daily Telegraph said that there is no sense of tempo or urgency in its songs departing from the stadium suited tempos of Swift s earlier works Esquire noted Evermore s focus on sonic details and nuances rather than big hooks According to critic Tom Hull while Swift remains attentive to production details Evermore follows Folklore in abandoning pop glitz in favor of straightforward songcraft due in part to the pandemic shifting Swift s focus from arenas to homely settings Stereogum described it as a soft meditative consciously quiet album of restorative old school singer songwriter music In Slate s opinion Evermore has a more spacious ambience with lots of break unlike the maximalist minimalism of Folklore which had layers upon layers of restrained instrumental lines br br br Themes br Evermore is an intimate album heavily rooted in elaborate first person storytelling from third person perspectives character studies and narrative mythmaking It ventures deeper inside the imaginary world Swift built with Folklore blending facts and fiction Both albums share a common escapist concept but in contrast to Folklore s more introspective and romantic nature Evermore is bolder uninhibited playful and impressionistic delving extensively into Swift s ideas of adult love and pain The songs generally ruminate themes of forbidden love romantic neglect forgiveness marriage and infidelity revolving around a set of distinctive characters such as embattled couples scorned friends and complicated women Evermore also analyses conflicted emotions and possibilities aside noirish twists in plots br Like its sister album Evermore lyrically incorporates nature landscapes and objects in the sky such as crescent moon sunrise comets amber skies precipice willow clover and ivy Swift s trademark turns of phrase and wordplay are also abundant Variety observed that warmth amid iciness is a recurring lyrical motif American Songwriter opined that Evermore has Swift mostly writing the unhappily ever after anthology of marriages gone bad Slate also called it an anthology emphasizing her leap away from autobiography into songs that are either pure fictions or else lyrically symbolic in ways that don t act as romans clef Stereogum labeled the album observational fiction Pitchfork noted that Swift remains a versatile expressive vocalist and a wordy lyricist to magnify sad small moments Music theory professor Alyssa Barna said Swift adopts a static colorless timbre for both vocals and instrumentation in the album Spin remarked the exceedingly complex human emotions she unravels in Evermore with precision and devastation br br br Songs br Evermore opens with Willow a chamber folk love song propelled by picked guitars glockenspiel orchestrations programmed drums and a breathless chorus Champagne Problems is a mournful ballad with spacious oom pah piano chords entwining with a guitar arpeggio and choir vocals It depicts a struggling girlfriend whose mental issues disrupt her romantic relationship leading her to turn down her lover s proposal Gold Rush is a nimble chamber pop song with drums horns violins swiveling shifts in tempo and a dreamy chorus Its frenzy verses are couplets delivered in a pulsating rhythm over persistent beats with a red herring in its intro and outro made of layered vocals Expressing jealousy and insecurity towards an attractive subject Gold Rush limns the narrator s infatuation for the subject using a daydream and depicts her distaste at her own incapacitation in the face of beauty comparing it to gold rushes br br The fourth track Tis the Damn Season is a Christmas song It sees a female narrator arrive for her holidays at hometown Tupelo where she encounters her former lover and ends up in bed with him despite knowing the rekindled flame will not lead anywhere It is built around an electric guitar riff and the narrator is revealed to be a character named Dorothea later in the album Tolerate It recounts a young woman in an age gap relationship and depicts her internal agony and resentment towards her aloof unappreciative partner It is a slow building ballad guided by a muffled piano and tense synth beats Its plot was inspired by Rebecca the novel by English author Daphne du Maurier No Body No Crime opens with police sirens It is a twangy cinematic country pop rock and country rock song featuring Haim s harmonies It tells a macabre revenge tale of a woman named Este murdered by her husband in favor of his mistress The narrator is a friend of Este and takes revenge by murdering the unfaithful man br Happiness the melancholic seventh track is an ambient ballad driven by hazy synthesizers hi hats violin bass organs piano and drone The song channels a stream of consciousness in which the narrator empathizes with the subject after their divorce contemplates the split and apologizes for losing track of the facts and affirms happiness will be found again It contains references to The Great Gatsby Dorothea is an Americana song from the perspective of the male subject in Tis the Damn Season who stays in Tupelo while his high school lover Dorothea moves to Los Angeles for a Hollywood career He narrates his stories of her such as a skipped prom and feelings of separation and yearns for Dorothea s return to the simple rural life over a honky tonk piano tambourine and guitars It has been compared to Betty due to their similar perspectives br br The ninth track Coney Island is an alternative rock waltz and indie folk duet with Berninger The song depicts suburban nostalgia and recollects a couple s memories in Coney Island Swift s melodious vocals contrast Berninger s mumbled baritone Ivy is a folk song with elastic vocals and a jaunty chorus documenting a married woman s infidelity over a ticking arrangement of banjo picked guitar trumpet and Vernon s gentle harmonies It conveys her temptation for her secret lover and the realistic consequences that may hinder their affair using a metaphor of ivy vines growing over a stone house to represent her deep rooted attachment br Swift sings about two gold digging con artists in the eleventh track Cowboy Like Me they unexpectedly fall in love with each other while frequenting resorts and deceiving the rich It is an alternative country folk rock and blues tune with hushed guitars harmonica riff mandolin piano lap steel and Mumford s backing vocals Long Story Short is a pop infused indie rock song with a rousing post chorus hook explosive guitars strings crisp beats of live drums and drum machine Swift retreads Reputation in the song summarizing her life s worst moments and emotional healing Marjorie details Swift s grief over her grandmother Marjorie Finlay a former opera singer who died when Swift was years old Its lyrics consist of Finlay s advice to her granddaughter as well as Swift s memories and regrets It includes soft tracks of Finlay singing over buzzing synths pizzicato strings drone pulse cello and a pulsing keyboard arrangement br Closure the fourteenth track is Swift s kiss off to the song s unnamed subject a reply to their self serving request insincere kindness and pretentious amity It is an industrial folk song characterized by an unusual time signature and a skittering production of brass piano to and fro strings electronic creaks clattering percussion and synth drums The standard edition of the album ends with the title track a piano ballad that progresses into a dramatic bridge after a tempo shift where Swift is joined midway by Vernon s signature falsetto in a call and response Swift navigates depression desolation and negative notions in her verses in contrast to Vernon s optimistic and supportive verses that attempt to help her resulting in a realization that pain is temporary The deluxe edition of Evermore includes two bonus tracks Right Where You Left Me is a country and folk pop song portraying the fate of a love frozen in time over twangy guitars In contrast It s Time to Go is about the narrator s knowledge of when to exit a relationship such as a friendship featuring tales of divorce and losing a dream career to an unfit individual the song contains references to Swift s dispute over her masters br br br Art direction br The visual aesthetic of Evermore takes upon a wintry theme a yuletide version of the cottagecore woodland aesthetic of Folklore Time stated that Folklore is a muted autumnal palette of sounds and feelings whereas Evermore is its winter companion with lingering sadness and regret While Folklore adapts a grayscale monochrome Evermore employs colors The Times of India opined that Evermore embraces s era Laurel Canyon br br br Cover artwork br The cover artwork of Evermore shows Swift in a barren field facing away from the camera looking over the bare trees in the distance She is seen standing at the edge of a forested area while on the cover

while Folklore is the introspective romantic older sister Mylrea thought Evermore is looser and more experimental expanding on its predecessor s sonic palette In congruence American Songwriter
