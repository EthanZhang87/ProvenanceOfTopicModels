Cashbox also known as Cash Box is an American music industry trade magazine originally published weekly from July to November Ten years after its dissolution it was revived and continues as Cashbox Magazine an online magazine with weekly charts and occasional special print issues In addition to the music industry the magazine covered the amusement arcade industry including jukebox machines and arcade games br br br History br br br Print edition charts br Cashbox was one of several magazines that published record charts in the United States Its most prominent competitors were Billboard and Record World known as Music Vendor prior to April Unlike Billboard Cashbox combined all currently available recordings of a song into one chart position with artist and label information shown for each version alphabetized by label Originally no indication of which version was the biggest seller was given but from October a star was placed next to the names of the most important artists Cashbox also printed shorter jukebox charts that included specific artist data beginning in spring Separate charts were presented for jukebox popularity record sales and radio airplay This was similar to Billboard s methodology prior to August when Billboard debuted its Hot which attempted to combine all measures of popularity into one all encompassing chart In addition Cashbox published chart data for specific genres such as country music and R B music In Cashbox discontinued its R B chart after the March issue it was reinstated in the December issue due to popular demand The chart was originally dropped because it became dominated by pop records br Cashbox was a competitor to Billboard through the s and s but two factors spelled its decline in the s Archivist and record historian Joel Whitburn published his first research book based on the Billboard Hot which made that data the Bible for official historic chart positions In addition the syndicated radio series American Top with Casey Kasem used Billboard chart statistics cementing Billboard as the dominant chart data for current and historic reference Magazine publisher George Albert compiled Cashbox chart data for a reference book more than a decade later and Dick Clark used Cashbox information for a time on his National Music Survey beginning in However by that time the trend was set br Perhaps the final straw for Cashbox came on December when the Top chart reported the number one song as The Letter by Wayne Newton The song did not even make the bottom of any Billboard chart nor was it reported to be in the top ten by local radio charts or sales reports This called the magazine s integrity into question Cashbox lost considerable credibility within the industry after this with accusations of chart fixing No official findings of the Newton incident were ever revealed Cashbox would subsequently print its final consecutive chart of this era in November br In the former Cashbox Magazine became involved in a murder trial after police in Nashville Tennessee made an arrest in a cold case Kevin Hughes was a small town boy from southeastern Illinois who spent his childhood focused on music and creating his own country music charts As a young man of Hughes thought he had landed his dream job in Nashville as the chart director for Cashbox s country music chart for up and coming artists He compiled data from jukebox plays record sales and radio play to determine the Cashbox chart positions of various country music records He reportedly was looking to introduce more scientific and transparent methods of determining chart positions when a year into his job he was gunned down in the street late one night on Nashville s famous Music Row After years of investigation police arrested his former Cashbox coworker Richard D Antonio for the murder Prosecutors maintained the killing was in connection with a payola scheme where record promoter Chuck Dixon paid Cashbox employees for favorable chart positions and other publicity A Dixon client was once named Cashbox s Male Vocalist of the Year without having sold a single record Hughes was reportedly killed for not going along with the chart fixing scheme D Antonio a Cashbox employee associated with Dixon was convicted of first degree murder in and died in prison in Dixon had already died a few years prior to D Antonio s arrest br br br
