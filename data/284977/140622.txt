Decca Records is a British record label established in by Edward Lewis Its US label was established in late by Lewis Jack Kapp the first president of the Decca Record company of the USA and Milton Rackmil who later became American Decca s president too In anticipating Nazi aggression leading to World War II Lewis sold American Decca and the link between the UK and US Decca label was broken for several decades The British label was renowned for its development of recording methods while the American company developed the concept of cast albums in the musical genre br In following World War II British Decca re established distribution in the United States through its new subsidiary London Records The London trademark name has also been used in other countries such as Canada Mexico Germany and Japan br The US Decca label became MCA Records which formed half of what is now UMG Universal Music Group Both UK and US divisions of the former Decca label are now part of Universal Music Group br br br Label name br The name dates back to a portable gramophone called the Decca Dulcephone patented in by musical instrument makers Barnett Samuel and Sons The name Decca was coined by Wilfred S Samuel by merging the word Mecca with the initial D of their logo Dulcet or their trademark Dulcephone Samuel a linguist chose Decca as a brand name as it was easy to pronounce in most languages That company was eventually renamed the Decca Gramophone Co Ltd and then sold to former stockbroker Edward Lewis in Within years Decca Records was the second largest record label in the world calling itself The Supreme Record Company Decca bought the UK branch of Brunswick Records and continued to run it under that name In the s the American Decca studios were located in the Pythian Temple in New York City br br br Classical music br br In classical music Decca had a long way to go from its modest beginnings to catch up with the established HMV and Columbia labels later merged as EMI The pre war classical repertoire on Decca was not extensive but was select The disc recording of Delius s Sea Drift arising from the Delius Festival that year suffered by being crammed onto six sides being indifferently recorded and expensive following issue in July they were already withdrawn by October the same year However it won Decca the loyalty of the baritone Roy Henderson who went on to record for them the first complete Dido and Aeneas of Purcell with Nancy Evans and the Boyd Neel ensemble Purcell Club sides issued February and Henderson s famous pupil Kathleen Ferrier was recorded and issued by Decca through the period of transition from to LP Heinrich Schlusnus made important pre war lieder recordings for Decca br Decca s emergence as a major classical label may be attributed to three concurrent events the emphasis on technical innovation first the development of the full frequency range recording ffrr technique then the early use of stereo recording the introduction of the long playing record and the recruitment of John Culshaw to Decca s London office br Decca released the stereo recordings of Ernest Ansermet conducting L Orchestre de la Suisse Romande including in the first complete stereo LP recording of The Nutcracker as well as Ansermet s only stereo version of Manuel de Falla s The Three Cornered Hat which the conductor had led at its first performance in br John Culshaw who joined Decca in in a junior post rapidly became a senior producer of classical recordings He revolutionised recording of opera in particular Hitherto the practice had been to put microphones in front of the performers and simply record what they performed Culshaw was determined to make recordings that would be a theatre of the mind making the listener s experience at home not merely second best to being in the opera house but a wholly different experience To that end he got the singers to move about in the studio as they would onstage used discreet sound effects and different acoustics and recorded in long continuous takes His skill coupled with Decca s sound engineering capabilities took the label into the first flight of recording companies His pioneering recording begun in of Wagner s Der Ring des Nibelungen conducted by Georg Solti was a huge artistic and commercial success to the chagrin of other companies Solti recorded throughout his career for Decca and made more than recordings including complete opera sets Among the international honours given to Solti and Decca for his recordings were Grammy awards more than any other recording artist whether classical or popular In the wake of Decca s lead artists such as Herbert von Karajan Joan Sutherland and later Luciano Pavarotti were keen to join the label s roster br However Culshaw was strictly speaking not the first to do this In Columbia Records executive Goddard Lieberson partnered with Broadway conductor Lehman Engel to record a series of previously unrecorded Broadway musical scores for Columbia Masterworks including what Engel in his book The American Musical Theatre A Consideration termed Broadway opera and in they released the most complete Porgy and Bess recorded up to that time Far from being a mere rendering of the score the LP album set used sound effects to realistically recreate the production as if the listener were watching a stage performance of the work br br Until American Decca issued British Decca classical music recordings Afterward British Decca took over distribution through its new American subsidiary London Records American Decca actively re entered the classical music field in with distribution deals from Deutsche Grammophon and Parlophone American Decca began issuing its classical music recordings in when Israel Horowitz joined Decca to head its classical music operations To further American Decca s dedication to serious music in August Rackmill announced the release of a new series of disks to be known as the Decca Gold Label Series which was to be devoted to symphonies concertos chamber music opera songs and choral music American and European artists were to be the performers Among the classical recordings released on Decca s Gold Label series were albums by Leroy Anderson the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conducted by Max Rudolf and guitarist Andr s Segovia American Decca shut down its classical music department in br br Between and Decca championed new music through its Headline imprint Works given their recorded premiere included pieces by Peter Maxwell Davies Harrison Birtwistle Luciano Berio Hans Werner Henze Witold Lutoslawski Toru Takemitsu David Bedford Thea Musgrave Andrzej Panufnik Iannis Xenakis Brian Ferneyhough and John Cage Performers included Roger Woodward Stomu Yamash ta Salman Shukur and the Grimethorpe Colliery Band as well as the composers themselves br For many years Decca s British classical recordings had been issued in the US under the London Records label because the existence of the American Decca company precluded the use of that name on British recordings distributed in the US When the MCA and PolyGram labels merged in and created Universal Music the practice was no longer necessary Today Decca makes fewer major classical recordings but still has a full roster of stars including Cecilia Bartoli and Ren e Fleming Its back catalogue includes several landmarks and critically acclaimed recordings such as the Solti Ring voted the greatest recording of all time by critics with the BBC Music Magazine and Luciano Pavarotti remained an exclusive Decca artist throughout his recording career br In Universal Music revived Decca s American classical music arm as Decca Gold under the management of Verve Music Group br br br Popular music br br In Britain Decca bought out the bankrupt UK branch of Brunswick Records in which added such stars as Bing Crosby and Al Jolson br to its roster Decca also bought out the Melotone and Edison Bell record companies In late a United States branch of Decca was launched In establishing the American unit the founders bought the former Brunswick Records pressing plants in New York City and Muskegon Michigan which were shut down in from Warner Bros in exchange for a financial interest in the new label In Guy Lombardo also recorded for Decca Decca became a major player in the depressed American record market thanks to its roster of popular artists particularly Bing Crosby the shrewd management of former US Brunswick general manager Jack Kapp and the decision to price Decca at cents The US label also brought back the discontinued Champion label from Gennett as well as a short lived version of the Broadway label The following year the pressing and Canadian distribution of US Decca records was licensed to Compo Company Ltd in Lachine Quebec a breakaway and rival of Berliner Gram o phone Co of Montreal Quebec Compo was acquired by Decca in although its Apex label continued in production for the next two decades By Decca and EMI were the only record companies in the UK That year British Decca head Edward Lewis sold his interest in American Decca because of World War II br In American Decca acquired Brunswick Records and its sublabel Vocalion Records from Warner Bros which had a financial interest in Decca In stock in American Decca began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as Decca Records Inc Therefore the two Deccas became separate companies and remained so until American Decca s parent company bought British Decca s parent company in during this time US Decca artists were issued in the UK on the Brunswick label until when MCA Records was launched in the UK br In American Decca released the first album of songs from the film The Wizard of Oz However it was not a soundtrack album but a cover version featuring only Judy Garland from the film with other roles taken by the Ken Darby Singers br In American Decca released the first recording of White Christmas by Bing Crosby He recorded another version of the song in for Decca to this day Crosby s recording of White Christmas for Decca remains the best selling single worldwide of all time In American Decca ushered in the age of the original cast album in the United States when they released an album set of nearly all the songs from Rodgers and Hammerstein s Oklahoma performed by the same cast who appeared in the show on Broadway and using the show s orchestra conductor chorus and musical and vocal arrangements The enormous success of this album was followed by original cast recordings of Carousel and Irving Berlin s Annie Get Your Gun both featuring members of the original casts of the shows and utilising those shows vocal and choral arrangements Because of the technical restrictions of recording on rpm records none of these scores were recorded completely they were shorter than cast albums made after LPs were introduced But Decca had made history by recording Broadway musicals and the influence of these releases in the recording of theatrical shows in the US continues to this day in Decca s home country the UK original cast albums had been a fixture for years Columbia Records followed with musical theatre albums starting with the revival of Show Boat In RCA Victor released the original cast album of Brigadoon By the s many recording companies were releasing Broadway show albums recorded by their original casts and the recording of original cast albums had become standard practice whenever a new show opened br Decca throughout the s and early to mid s was a leading label of blues and jump music with such best selling artists as Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Louis Jordan who was the best selling R B artist of the s In American Decca released Rock Around the Clock by Bill Haley His Comets Produced by Milt Gabler the recording was initially only moderately successful but when it was used as the theme song for the film Blackboard Jungle it became the first international rock and roll hit and the first such recording to go to No on the American musical charts According to the Guinness Book of Records it went on to sell million copies returning to the US and UK charts several times between and But due to management and promotion decisions Decca lost its place as a major hit label on the US R B and pop charts as Bill Haley s popularity started to fade in the late s Decca s strong country catalogue did very well throughout this period and they had several crossover to pop hits as well as the blockbuster success of Brenda Lee but many R B and rock music artists passed through Decca with little success The Flamingos Billy Ward and his Dominoes Bobby Darin The Shirelles etc br American Decca embraced the new post war record formats adopting the LP in and the rpm record around a year later while continuing to sell s During the s American Decca released several soundtrack recordings of popular motion pictures notably Mike Todd s production of Around the World in Eighty Days with the music of veteran film composer Victor Young Since Decca had access to the stereo tracks of the Oscar winning film they quickly released a stereo version in Because American Decca bought Universal Pictures in many of these soundtrack albums were of films released by what was then called Universal International Pictures br In June and July Decca Records released the soundtracks from Hecht Hill Lancaster Productions film Sweet Smell of Success It was a landmark event in the soundtrack industry the first time that a film had two separate soundtracks each featuring completely different music All of the music from Sweet Smell of Success was published by Calyork Music a music publishing company founded by the film s producers Harold Hecht and Burt Lancaster along with Hecht s brother in law established music publisher Loring Buzzell who secured the releasing of the music through Decca Records The first soundtrack LP featured the jazz score composed by Elmer Bernstein while the second soundtrack LP featured music composed and performed by the Chico Hamilton Quintet a band that appears in the film br In American Decca released the soundtrack album of Flower Drum Song Universal Pictures film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical In a reversal of the usual situation in which American Decca had released original Broadway cast albums of three Rodgers and Hammerstein shows this was the only film soundtrack album of a Rodgers and Hammerstein show ever released by Decca while the Broadway cast album had been released by Columbia Masterworks br The American RCA label severed its longtime affiliation with EMI s His Master s Voice HMV label in which allowed British Decca to market and distribute Elvis Presley s recordings in the UK on the RCA label later RCA Victor br British Decca had several missed opportunities In they refused to release Tell Laura I Love Her by licensed artist Ray Peterson and even destroyed thousands of copies of the single In Decca famously turned down a chance to record The Beatles believing guitar groups are on the way out Other refusals of note include the Yardbirds the Kinks the Who and Manfred Mann Decca had earlier accepted London born pioneer rock n roll singer Terry Dene who was later known as the British Elvis Presley and another Merseyside singer Billy Fury br The turning down of The Beatles led indirectly to the signing of one of Decca s biggest s artists The Rolling Stones Dick Rowe was judging a talent contest with George Harrison and Harrison mentioned to him that he should take a look at the Stones who he had just seen live for the first time a couple of weeks earlier Rowe saw the Stones and quickly signed them to a contract Decca also released the first recording of Rod Stewart in Good Morning Little Schoolgirl I m Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town Decca also signed up many rock artists The Moody Blues The Zombies The Applejacks Dave Berry Lulu Alan Price The Marmalade with varying degrees of success br Staff producer Hugh Mendl worked for Decca for over years and played a significant role in its success in the popular field from the s to the late s His first major production credit was pianist Winifred Atwell He produced Rock Island Line the breakthrough skiffle hit for Lonnie Donegan and he is credited as the first executive to spot the potential of singer actor Tommy Steele Mendl s other productions included the first album by humorist Ivor Cutler Who Tore Your Trousers Frankie Howerd at The Establishment a series of recordings with Paddy Roberts best known for The Ballad of Bethnal Green numerous original cast and soundtrack albums including Oh What a Lovely War and even an LP record of the Le Mans hour race inspired by his lifelong passion for motor racing Mendl was a driving force in the establishment of Decca s progressive Deram label most notably as the executive producer of The Moody Blues groundbreaking LP Days of Future Passed He is credited with battling against Decca s notorious parsimonious treatment of their artists ensuring that the Moody Blues had the time and resources to develop beyond their beat group origins into progressive rock and he also used profits for pop sales to cross subsidise recordings by avant garde jazz artists like John Surman br British Decca lost a key source for American records when Atlantic Records switched British distribution to Polydor Records in for Atlantic to gain access to British recording artists which they did not have under Decca distribution The Rolling Stones left Decca in and other artists followed Decca s deals with numerous other record labels began to fall apart RCA Records for instance abandoned Decca to set up its own UK office in June just before the Rolling Stones decided to also abandon Decca in favour of forming their label The Moody Blues were the only international rock act that remained on the label The company s fortunes declined slightly during the s and it had few major commercial successes among those were Dana s two million selling single All Kinds of Everything issued on their subsidiary label Rex Records br Although Decca had set up the first of the British progressive labels Deram in with such stars as Cat Stevens and the Moody Blues by the time the punk era set in Decca had pop success with such acts as John Miles novelty creation Father Abraham and the Smurfs and productions by longtime Decca associate Jonathan King King had a hit Everyone s Gone to the Moon on Decca while he was an undergraduate at Trinity College Cambridge and Edward Lewis recruited him as his personal assistant and talent spotter Decca became dependent on re releases from its back catalogue Contemporary signings such as Slaughter the Dogs and the pre stardom Adam and the Ants whose sole single with Decca Young Parisians would later be a UK Top hit on the back of the band s success at CBS were second division when compared to the likes of PolyGram CBS EMI and newcomer Virgin s rosters of hitmakers br br br Spoken word br American Decca also released several notable spoken word albums such as a recording of Charles Dickens s A Christmas Carol starring Ronald Colman as Scrooge and a recording of the Christmas chapter from The Pickwick Papers read by Charles Laughton These two separate RPM albums were later combined into one LP Other spoken word albums included Lullaby of Christmas narrated by Gregory Peck a twenty minute version of Moby Dick with Charles Laughton as Captain Ahab and The Littlest Angel narrated by Loretta Young British Decca released on LP in the most complete version of Man of La Mancha ever put on vinyl records a LP album featuring most of the dialogue and all of the songs performed by the show s original London cast Keith Michell starred as Don Quixote and Cervantes and Joan Diener was Aldonza Dulcinea Around American Decca enjoyed success with LPS of soundtrack dialogue excerpts from the films of W C Fields the Marx Brothers and Mae West The Fields and Marx Brothers albums were narrated by radio personality and cartoon voice actor Gary Owens br br br Country music br br In Jack Kapp established a country western line for the new Decca label by signing Frank Luther Sons of the Pioneers Stuart Hamblen The Ranch Boys and other popular acts based in both New York and Los Angeles Louisiana singer composer Jimmie Davis began recording for Decca the same year joined by western vocalists Jimmy Wakely and Roy Rogers in From the late s on the US arm of Decca had a sizeable roster of country artists The main architect of Decca s success in country music was Owen Bradley who joined Decca in and was promoted to vice president and head of A R for the Nashville operations in br br br Technology developments br br br Full frequency range recording ffrr br Full frequency range recording ffrr was a spin off devised by Arthur Haddy of British Decca s development during the Second World War of a high fidelity hydrophone capable of detecting and cataloguing individual German submarines by each one s signature engine noise and enabled a greatly enhanced frequency range high and low notes to be captured on recordings Critics regularly commented on the startling realism of the new Decca recordings The frequency range of ffrr was Hz with a signal to noise ratio of dB While Decca s early ffrr releases on rpm discs had some noticeable surface noise which diminished the effects of the high fidelity sound the introduction of long playing records in made better use of the new technology and set an industry standard that was quickly imitated by Decca s competitors Nonetheless titles first issued on rpm remained in that form in the Decca catalogues into the early s The ffrr technique became internationally accepted and considered a standard The Ernest Ansermet recording of Stravinsky s Petrushka was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in br br br The LP br The long playing record was launched in the US in by Columbia Records not connected with the British company of the same name at the time It enabled recordings to play for up to half an hour without a break compared with the three to five minutes playing time of the existing records The new records were made of vinyl the old discs were made of brittle shellac which enabled the ffrr recordings to be transferred to disc very realistically In in both the UK and the US Decca took up the LP promptly and enthusiastically giving the British arm an enormous advantage over EMI which for some years tried to stick exclusively to the old format thereby forfeiting competitive advantage to Decca both artistically and financially br British Decca recorded high fidelity versions of all the symphonies of Ralph Vaughan Williams except for the ninth under the personal supervision of the composer with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra Benjamin Britten conducted recordings of many of his compositions for Decca from the s to the s most of these recordings have been reissued on CD br br br Stereo ffss br The British Decca recording engineers Arthur Haddy Roy Wallace and Kenneth Wilkinson developed in the famous Decca tree a stereo microphone recording system for big orchestras br Decca started the first actual stereophonic recording on May at Victoria Hall Geneva the first European record company to do so only two months before RCA Victor had begun the first actual stereophonic recording in the US March Decca archives show that Ernest Ansermet and the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande recorded Antar by Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov Decca s official first actual stereo recording Stenka Razin by Alexander Glazunov Tamara by Mily Balakirev Anatoly Liadov s Baba Yaga Eight Russian Folksongs Kikimora and Le Martyre de saint S bastien by Claude Debussy These performances were initially issued only in monaural sound and in the stereo version of Le Martyre de saint S bastien was issued only in the US as London OSA OS and stereo versions of others were finally issued from the late s to the beginning of the s as part of the Ace of Diamonds series and Decca Eclipse series in the UK or Stereo Treasury series in the US on the London label br The Decca stereo format was called in succession to ffrr ffss i e full frequency stereophonic sound With most competitors not using stereo until the new technique was a distinctive feature of Decca Even after stereo became standard and into the s Decca boasted a special sound quality characterized by aggressive use of the highest and lowest frequencies novel use of tape saturation and out of phase sound to convey a livelier hall ambiance plus considerable bar to bar rebalancing by the recording staff of orchestral voices known as spotlighting In the s and s the company developed its Phase process which produced even greater sonic impact through even more interventionist engineering techniques Big band leader Ted Heath was an early pioneer of the Decca Phase sound Decca recorded some quadrophonic masters that were released in Sansui s quadraphonic system called QS Regular Matrix br br br Digital recording and mastering br Starting in late British Decca developed its own digital audio recorders used in house for recording mixing editing and mastering albums Each recorder consisted of a modified IVC model P open reel inch VTR connected to a custom codec unit with time code capability using a proprietary time code developed by Decca as well as outboard DAC and ADC units connected to the codec unit The codec recorded audio to tape in bit linear PCM at kHz with a maximum of eight channels Later versions of the system used bit recording Except for the IVC VTRs which were modified to Decca s specifications by IVC s UK division in Reading all the electronics for these systems were developed and manufactured in house by Decca and by contractors to them as well These digital systems were used for mastering most of Decca s classical music releases to both LP and CD and were used well into the late s After the start of the new century Decca became actively involved in pioneering a new generation of high resolution and multi channel recordings including Super Audio CD SACD and DVD Audio DVD A formats Decca is now routinely mastering new recordings in these formats br br br Decca Special Products br Decca Special Products developed products for the audio marketplace and a line of home audio equipment br br br Later history br American Decca bought Universal International in and eventually merged with MCA Inc in becoming a subsidiary company under MCA Dissatisfied with American Decca s promotion of British Decca recordings and because American Decca held the rights to the name Decca in the US and Canada British Decca sold its records in the United States and Canada under the label London Records beginning in In Britain London Records became a mighty catch all licensing label for foreign recordings from the nascent post WW II American independent and semi major labels such as Cadence Dot Chess Atlantic Imperial and Liberty br Conversely British Decca retained a non reciprocal right to license and issue American Decca recordings in the UK on their Brunswick US Decca recordings and Coral US Brunswick and Coral recordings labels this arrangement continued until when a UK branch of MCA was established utilizing the MCA Records label with distribution fluctuating between British Decca and other English companies over time br In Canada the Compo Company was reorganized into MCA Records Canada in br The Decca name was dropped by MCA in America in in favor of the MCA Records label The first run American Decca label s final release Drift Away by Dobie Gray label No reached No on the Billboard chart and received gold record status br PolyGram acquired the remains of Decca UK within days of Sir Edward Lewis s death in January British Decca s pop catalogue was taken over by Polydor Records Ironically PolyGram descended from British Decca s former Dutch distributor Hollandsche Decca Distributie br In Taiwan PolyGram acquired of Linfair Magnetic Sound founded in in and renamed it Decca Records Taiwan The name remained until when it decided to sell its percent stake and changed its name to Linfair Records making the company independent from Universal Music In addition to the Decca label Linfair Records also distributes V Records releases and some independent labels However Linfair Records releases outside Taiwan will continue to be released internationally via Universal Music br The Decca label is currently in use by Universal Music Group worldwide this is possible because Universal Studios which officially dropped the MCA name after the Seagram buyout in acquired PolyGram British Decca s parent company in thus consolidating Decca trademark ownership In the US the Decca country music label was shut down and the London classical label was renamed as it was able to use the Decca name for the first time because of the merger that created Universal Music In Decca absorbed Philips Records to create the Decca Music Group half of Universal Music Classics Group in the US with Deutsche Grammophon being the other half br Today Decca is a leading label for both classical music and Broadway scores although it is branching out into pop music from established recording stars in its Motown A Journey Through Hitsville USA by Boyz II Men reached No on the Billboard Top Albums chart In they won the race to sign English teen jazz sensation Victoria Hart and released her first album Whatever Happened to Romance in July In December it was announced that Morrissey would be joining the Decca roster In August it was revealed that American Idol alum Clay Aiken had signed with Decca It reentered the American country music scene in There are two Universal Music label groups now using the Decca name The Decca Label Group is the US label whereas the London based Decca Music Group runs the international classical and pop releases by such world famous performers as Andrea Bocelli and Hayley Westenra The London Records pop label that was established in the UK in run by Roger Ames and distributed by PolyGram became part of Warner Music Group in when he was hired to run that company Universal Music reacquired trademark rights in and Warner Records Ltd formerly London Records a company that controlled most of London s post catalogue was acquired by French company Because Music in They started licensing London Recordings name and logo from UMG and Warner Records was renamed London Music Stream Ltd br It is also the distributing label of POINT Music a joint venture between Universal and Philip Glass s Euphorbia Productions that folded shortly after the merger that created Universal Music Ironically the American Decca classical music catalogue is managed by sister Universal label Deutsche Grammophon They include the recordings of guitarist Andr s Segovia Before Deutsche Grammophon founded its own American branch in it had a distribution deal with American Decca until when distribution switched to MGM Records ditions de l Oiseau Lyre is a wholly owned subsidiary specialising in European classical music of the th to th centuries American Decca s jazz catalogue is managed by GRP Records an imprint of Verve Records The American Decca rock pop catalogue is managed by Geffen Records American distribution of British Decca s rock pop catalogue is handled by Island Records The Decca Broadway imprint is used for both newly recorded musical theatre songs and Universal Music Group s vast catalogues of musical theatre recordings from record labels UMG and predecessor companies acquired over the years br On January Universal Music Group which owns the masters to Decca Records announced that it was donating of its master recordings from the s to the s to the United States Library of Congress The collection of master recordings will be cleaned and digitised Included in this group are Bing Crosby s original recording of White Christmas and thousands more by Louis Armstrong Ella Fitzgerald Billie Holiday Judy Garland Tommy Dorsey Jimmy Dorsey the Andrews Sisters and other famous and lesser known musicians who recorded during this time Because of this transaction once the Library has organised and cleaned the collection the public will eventually have some degree of access to thousands of recordings that have been commercially unavailable for decades According to the Los Angeles Times a s part of the agreement between UMG and the library Universal retains ownership of the recording copyrights and the right to exploit the cleaned up and digitized files for commercial purposes br Today Decca distributes UMG s jazz holdings led by Blue Note Records and Verve Records along with the classical music holdings led by Decca Classics Philips Records and Deutsche Grammophon It also distributes
