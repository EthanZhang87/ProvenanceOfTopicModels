white top with black shorts and black and green hooped socks The top also featured the Marist Brothers badge on the right hand side consisting of a green Celtic cross inside a red circle In the club changed to a green and white vertically striped top and for the next fourteen years this remained unchanged although the colour of the shorts alternated between white and black several times over this period The top did not feature a crest br In Celtic adopted their now famous green and white hooped tops The new design was worn for the first time on August in a match against Partick Thistle Black socks continued to be worn until the early s at which point the team switched to green socks Plain white socks came into use in the mid s and white has been the predominant colour worn since then br br The club began using a badge in the s featuring a four leaf clover logo surrounded by the club s formal title The Celtic Football and Athletic Coy Ltd However it was not until that Celtic finally adopted the club crest on their shirts The outer segment was reversed out with white lettering on a green background on the team shirts The text around the clover logo on the shirts was also shortened from the official club crest to The Celtic Football Club For their centenary year in a commemorative crest was worn featuring the Celtic cross that appeared on their first shirts The version was reinstated for season br From onwards numbered shirts slowly came into use throughout Scotland before becoming compulsory in By this time Celtic were the last club in Britain to adopt the use of numbers on the team strip to identify players The traditionalist and idealistic Celtic chairman Robert Kelly baulked at the prospect of the famous green and white hoops being disfigured and as such Celtic wore their numbers on the players shorts This unusual tradition survived until although numbered shirts were worn in European competition from onwards Celtic s tradition of wearing numbers on their shorts rather than on the back of their shirts was brought to an end when the Scottish Football League instructed Celtic to wear numbers on their shirts from the start of the season Celtic responded by adding numbers to the top of their sleeves however within a few weeks the football authorities ordered the club to attach them to the back of their shirts where they appeared on a large white patch breaking up the green and white hoops br In Celtic took up shirt sponsorship for the first time with Fife based double glazing firm CR Smith having their logo emblazoned on the front of the team jersey In season Celtic switched to Glasgow based car sales company Peoples as sponsors The club failed to secure a shirt sponsor for season and for the first time since the early s Celtic

strip based on the first strip from was also adopted for the season br In March Celtic agreed a new kit deal worth million with Boston based sportswear manufacturer New Balance to replace Nike from the start of the season br All of the kits for the season paid tribute to the Lisbon Lions with the kits having a line on each side to represent the handles of the European Cup The kits also included a commemorative crest designed specifically for the season The regular crest was reinstated the following season although the away strip featured a Celtic cross once again in reference to the club s

Glasgow notably James Grant an Irish publican and engineer James Kelly one of the club s original players turned publican and John Glass a builder and driving force in the early years of the club His shares upon his death in passed on to Thomas White The Grant Kelly and White families shareholdings dominated ownership of the club throughout the th century br br The late s saw Robert Kelly son of James Kelly become chairman of the club after having been a director since Desmond White also joined the board around this time upon the death of his father Thomas White By the s a significant number of shares in the club had passed to Neil and Felicia Grant who lived in Toomebridge County Antrim These shares accounted for more than a sixth of the club s total issue Club chairman Robert Kelly s own family share holding was of a similar size and he used his close relationship with the Toomebridge Grants to ensure his power base at Celtic was unchallengeable When Neil Grant died in the early s his shareholding passed to his sister Felicia leaving her as the largest share holder in Celtic This gave rise to the myth among Celtic supporters of the old lady in Ireland who supposedly had the ultimate say in the running of the club br Celtic s board of directors had a reputation of being miserly and authoritarian In particular they were known for frequently selling their top players and not paying their staff enough they were also seen as lacking ambition which caused friction with several managers Jimmy McGrory s tenure as manager is generally considered a period of underachievement but with Chairman Robert Kelly s domineering influence many have questioned how much authority McGrory ever had in team selection Even Jock Stein s time as manager ended on a sour note when he was offered a place on the Celtic board but in a role involving ticket sales Stein felt that this was demeaning stating he was a football man not a ticket salesman He declined this offer and decided to stay in football management joining Leeds United instead Billy McNeill won a trophy in each of his five seasons as manager but was still paid less than the managers of Rangers Aberdeen and Dundee United He left the club in June after his request for a contract and pay rise was publicly rebuffed by the board McNeill moved on to manage Manchester City stating that to remain at Celtic would have been humiliating McNeill s successor Davie Hay also had his difficulties with the Celtic board When trying to sign players in to strengthen his squad to compete with high spending Rangers the board refused to pay for them chairman Jack McGinn was quoted as saying that if Hay wanted these players he will have to pay for them himself br By the end of the s the Celtic board consisted of chairman McGinn and directors Kevin Kelly Chris White Tom Grant and Jimmy Farrell Neither McGinn nor Farrell were members of the traditional family dynasties at Celtic Farrell was a partner in the Shaughnessy

however as a dispute about a proposed relocation to Robroyston resulted in him being voted off the board five months later br br br McCann takeover and transition to plc br Throughout the s and s

Traynor described McCann s attempt to buy the club as good against evil Despite declining attendances and increasing unrest amongst supporters the Kelly White and Grant family groupings continued to guard their control of Celtic br On March McCann bought Celtic for million finally wresting control from the family dynasties that had run the club for almost years When he bought the club it was reported to be within hours of entering receivership due to exceeding a million overdraft with the Bank of Scotland He turned Celtic into a public limited company through a share issue which raised over million the most successful share issue in British football history He also oversaw the building of a new stadium the seater Celtic Park which cost million and at the time was Britain s largest club stadium This allowed Celtic to progress as a club because over million was being raised each year from season ticket sales br McCann had maintained that he would only be at Celtic for five years and in September he announced that his stake in Celtic was for sale McCann had wanted the ownership of Celtic to be spread as widely as possible and gave first preference to existing shareholders and season ticket holders to prevent a new consortium taking over the club million shares were sold by McCann at a value of pence each McCann made million out of this meaning he left Celtic with a million profit During his tenure turnover at Celtic rose by to m and operating profits rose from to m McCann was often criticised during his time at Celtic and many people disagreed with him over building a stadium which they thought Celtic could not fill not investing enough in the squad and being overly focused on finance However McCann was responsible for the financial recovery of the club and for providing a very good platform for it to build on After he left Celtic the club were able to invest in players and achieved much success such as winning the treble in and reaching the UEFA Cup Final
