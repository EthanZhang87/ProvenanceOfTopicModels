Broadway theatre or Broadway is a theatre genre that consists of the theatrical performances presented in professional theaters each with or more seats in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway in Midtown Manhattan New York City Broadway and London s West End together represent the highest commercial level of live theater in the English speaking world br While the Broadway thoroughfare is eponymous with the district it is closely identified with Times Square Only three theaters are located on Broadway itself Broadway Theatre Palace Theatre and Winter Garden Theatre The rest are located on the numbered cross streets extending from the Nederlander Theatre one block south of Times Square on West st Street north along either side of Broadway to rd Street and Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center on West th Street While exceptions exist the term Broadway theatre is used predominantly to describe venues with seating capacities of at least people Smaller theaters in New York City are referred to as off Broadway regardless of location while very small venues with fewer than seats are called off off Broadway a term that can also apply to non commercial avant garde or productions held outside of traditional theater venues br The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City According to The Broadway League for the season total attendance was Broadway shows had in grosses with attendance up grosses up and playing weeks up The Museum of Broadway on West th Street opened to the public in November became the first museum to document the history and experience of Broadway theatre and its profound influence upon shaping Midtown Manhattan and Times Square br Most Broadway shows are musicals Historian Martin Shefter argues that Broadway musicals culminating in the productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein became enormously influential forms of American popular culture and contributed to making New York City the cultural capital of the world br br New York City s first significant theatre was established in the mid th century around when actor managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street in Lower Manhattan which held about people They presented Shakespeare plays and ballad operas such as The Beggar s Opera In William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager They established a theatre in Williamsburg Virginia and opened with The Merchant of Venice and The Anatomist The company moved to New York in performing ballad operas and ballad farces like Damon and Phillida br During the Revolutionary War theatre was suspended in New York City But after the war s end theatre resumed in when the seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street on present day Park Row A second major theatre Bowery Theatre opened in followed by others br By the s P T Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in Lower Manhattan In at Broadway and Prince Street Niblo s Garden opened and soon became one of New York s premier nightspots The seat theatre presented all sorts of musical and non musical entertainments In Palmo s Opera House opened and presented opera for only four seasons before bankruptcy led to its rebranding as a venue for plays under the name Burton s Theatre The Astor Opera House opened in A riot broke out in when the lower class patrons of the Bowery Theatre objected to what they perceived as snobbery by the upper class audiences at Astor Place After the Astor Place Riot of entertainment in New York City was divided along class lines opera was chiefly for the upper middle and upper classes minstrel shows and melodramas for the middle class variety shows in concert saloons for men of the working class and the slumming middle class br The plays of William Shakespeare were frequently performed on the Broadway stage during the period most notably by American actor Edwin Booth who was internationally known for his performance as Hamlet Booth played the role for a famous consecutive performances at the Winter Garden Theatre in with the run ending just a few months before Booth s brother John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln and would later revive the role at his own Booth s Theatre which was managed for a time by his brother Junius Brutus Booth Jr Other renowned Shakespeareans who appeared in New York in this era were Henry Irving Tommaso Salvini Fanny Davenport and Charles Fechter br br Theatre in New York moved from Downtown gradually to Midtown Manhattan beginning around seeking less expensive real estate At the beginning of the nineteenth century the area that now comprises the Theater District was owned by a handful of families and comprised a few farms In Mayor Cornelius Lawrence opened nd Street and invited Manhattanites to enjoy the pure clean air Close to years later theatrical entrepreneur Oscar Hammerstein I built the iconic Victoria Theater on West nd Street br Broadway s first long run musical was a performance hit called The Elves in In the heart of Broadway was in Union Square and by the end of the century many theatres were near Madison Square Theatres arrived in the Times Square area in the early s and the Broadway theatres consolidated there after a large number were built around the square in the s and s New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London but Laura Keene s musical burletta The Seven Sisters shattered previous New York records with a run of performances It was at a performance by Keene s troupe of Our American Cousin in Washington D C that Abraham Lincoln was shot br br The first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story is considered to be The Black Crook which premiered in New York on September The production was five and a half hours long but despite its length it ran for a record breaking performances The same year The Black Domino Between You Me and the Post was the first show to call itself a musical comedy br Tony Pastor opened the first vaudeville theatre one block east of Union Square in where Lillian Russell performed Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between The Mulligan Guard Picnic and with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father in law David Braham These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York s lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque towards a more literate form They starred high quality professional singers Lillian Russell Vivienne Segal and Fay Templeton instead of the amateurs often sex workers who had starred in earlier musical forms br As transportation improved poverty in New York diminished and street lighting made for safer travel at night the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences leading to better profits and improved production values As in England during the latter half of the century the theatre began to be cleaned up with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women Gilbert and Sullivan s family friendly comic opera hits beginning with H M S Pinafore in were imported to New York by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven s Robin Hood and John Philip Sousa s El Capitan along with operas ballets and other British and European hits br br Charles H Hoyt s A Trip to Chinatown became Broadway s long run champion when it surpassed Adonis and its total performances in holding the stage for performances Chinatown itself was surpassed by the musical Irene in as the longest running Broadway musical and even earlier in March by Lightnin as the longest running Broadway show In theatre owners Marc Klaw and A L Erlanger formed the Theatrical Syndicate which controlled almost every legitimate theatre in the U S for the next sixteen years However smaller vaudeville and variety houses proliferated and Off Broadway was well established by the end of the nineteenth century br A Trip to Coontown was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans in a Broadway theatre inspired largely by the routines of the minstrel shows followed by the ragtime tinged Clorindy The Origin of the Cakewalk and the highly successful In Dahomey Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the s and early s made up of songs written in New York s Tin Pan Alley involving composers such as Gus Edwards John Walter Bratton and George M Cohan Little Johnny Jones Minutes From Broadway and George Washington Jr Still New York runs continued to be relatively short with a few exceptions compared with London runs until World War I br A few very successful British musicals continued to achieve great success in New York including Florodora in br br In the early years of the twentieth century translations of popular late nineteenth century continental operettas were joined by the Princess Theatre shows of the s by writers such as P G Wodehouse Guy Bolton and Harry B Smith Victor Herbert whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas The Fortune Teller Babes in Toyland Mlle Modiste The Red Mill and Naughty Marietta br Beginning with The Red Mill Broadway shows installed electric signs outside the theatres Since colored bulbs burned out too quickly white lights were used and Broadway was nicknamed The Great White Way In August the Actors Equity Association demanded a standard contract for all professional productions After a strike shut down all the theatres the producers were forced to agree By the s the Shubert Brothers had risen to take over the majority of the theatres from the Erlanger syndicate br During this time the play Lightnin by Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon became the first Broadway show to reach performances From then it would go on to become the first show to reach performances Lightnin was the longest running Broadway show until being overtaken in performance totals by Abie s Irish Rose in br br The motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage At first films were silent and presented only limited competition By the end of the s films like The Jazz Singer were presented with synchronized sound and critics wondered if cinema would replace live theatre altogether While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day other theatres survived The musicals of the Roaring Twenties borrowing from vaudeville music hall and other light entertainment tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses big dance routines and popular songs br Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song and dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes but there was little to tie the various numbers together Typical of the s were lighthearted productions such as Sally Lady Be Good Sunny No No Nanette Harlem Oh Kay and Funny Face Their books may have been forgettable but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin Cole Porter Jerome Kern Vincent Youmans and Rodgers and Hart among others and No l Coward Sigmund Romberg and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert Live theatre has survived the invention of cinema br br Leaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind and taking the drama a step forward Show Boat premiered on December at the Ziegfeld Theatre It represented a complete integration of book and score with dramatic themes as told through the music dialogue setting and movement woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals It ran for performances br The s also spawned a new age of American playwright with the emergence of Eugene O Neill whose plays Beyond the Horizon Anna Christie The Hairy Ape Strange Interlude and Mourning Becomes Electra proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway and O Neill s success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice Maxwell Anderson Robert E Sherwood Clifford Odets Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller as well as writers of comedy like George S Kaufman and Moss Hart Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre goers notably John Barrymore in Hamlet and Richard III John Gielgud in Hamlet The Importance of Being Earnest and Much Ado About Nothing Walter Hampden and Jos Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac Paul Robeson and Ferrer in Othello Maurice Evans in Richard II and the plays of George Bernard Shaw and Katharine Cornell in such plays as Romeo and Juliet Antony and Cleopatra and Candida br As World War II approached a dozen Broadway dramas addressed the rise of Nazism in Europe and the issue of American non intervention The most successful was Lillian Hellman s Watch on the Rhine which opened in April br br After the lean years of the Great Depression Broadway theatre had entered a golden age with the blockbuster hit Oklahoma in which ran for performances According to John Kenrick s writings on Broadway musicals Every season saw new stage musicals send songs to the top of the charts Public demand a booming economy and abundant creative talent kept Broadway hopping To this day the shows of the s form the core of the musical theatre repertory br br Kenrick notes that the late s marked a time of cultural upheaval All those changes would prove painful for many including those behind the scenes as well as those in the audience Of the s Kenrick writes Just when it seemed that traditional book musicals were back in style the decade ended with critics and audiences giving mixed signals br Ken Bloom observed that The s and s saw a worsening of the area Times Square and a drop in the number of legitimate shows produced on Broadway By way of comparison in the to season May to May productions opened on Broadway in the to season June to May there were productions fifteen were revivals In the twenties there were theaters but by there were left br During this time many Broadway productions struggled due to low attendance rates which resulted in perceived mediocrity among such plays For this reason the Theatre Development Fund was created with the purpose of assisting productions with high cultural value that likely would struggle without subsidization by offering tickets to those plays to consumers at reduced prices br br In early Joe Papp the theatrical producer and director who established The Public Theater led the Save the Theatres campaign It was a not for profit group supported by the Actors Equity union to save the theater buildings in the neighborhood from demolition by monied Manhattan development interests Papp provided resources recruited a publicist and celebrated actors and provided audio lighting and technical crews for the effort br At Papp s behest in July a bill was introduced in the th Congress entitled H R A bill to designate the Broadway Times Square Theatre District in the City of New York as a national historic site The legislation would have provided certain U S government resources and assistance to help the city preserve the district Faced with strong opposition and lobbying by Mayor Ed Koch s Administration and corporate Manhattan development interests the bill was not passed The Save the Theatres campaign then turned their efforts to supporting the establishment of the Theater District as a registered historic district In December Save the Theatres prepared The Broadway Theater District a Preservation Development and Management Plan and demanded that each theater in the district receive landmark designation Mayor Ed Koch ultimately reacted by creating a Theater Advisory Council which included Papp br br Due to the COVID pandemic in New York City Broadway theaters closed on March shuttering shows that were playing or were in the process of opening The Broadway League shutdown was extended first to April then to May then June then September and January and later to June Then governor Andrew Cuomo announced that most sectors of New York would have their restrictions lifted on May but he stated that Broadway theatres would not be able to immediately resume performances on this date due to logistical reasons In May Cuomo announced that Broadway theaters would be allowed to reopen on September and the League confirmed that performances would begin to resume in the fall season br Springsteen on Broadway became the first full length show to resume performances opening on June to vaccinated patrons at the St James Theatre Pass Over then had its first preview on August and opened on August becoming the first new play to open Hadestown and Waitress were the first musicals to resume performances on September The th Tony Awards were also postponed the Tony nominations were announced on October and took place on September On July it was announced that all Broadway theaters required attendees to provide proof of full COVID vaccination The rule applied to guests ages Those under age were required to provide a negative COVID test PCR within hours or antigen within six hours of the performance start time Beginning November those ages also had the option to provide proof of at least one vaccination shot Effective December in accordance with NYC s vaccination mandate guests ages were required to have at least one vaccination shot until January where they had to be fully vaccinated The vaccine mandate lasted until April and attendees were also required to wear face masks until July br During the COVID shutdown the Shubert Organization the Nederlander Organization and Jujamcyn had pledged to increase racial and cultural diversity in their theaters including naming at least one theater for a Black theatrical personality The August Wilson Theatre owned by Jujamcyn had been renamed after Black playwright August Wilson in The Shuberts announced in March that the Cort Theatre which was under renovation at the time would be renamed after actor James Earl Jones In June the Nederlanders announced that the Brooks Atkinson Theatre would be renamed after Lena Horne The James Earl Jones Theatre was rededicated in September while the Lena Horne Theatre was rededicated that November br br Although there are some exceptions shows with open ended runs generally have evening performances Tuesday through Saturday with a p m or p m curtain The afternoon matin e performances are at p m on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at p m on Sundays This makes for an eight performance week On this schedule most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres are said to be dark on that day The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Monday evening as their weekend The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule br In recent years some shows have moved their Tuesday show time an hour earlier to pm The rationale for this move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek Tuesday attendance depends more on local patrons The earlier curtain makes it possible for suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show Some shows especially those produced by Disney change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience br br Most Broadway producers and theatre owners are members of The Broadway League formerly The League of American Theatres and Producers a trade organization that promotes Broadway theatre as a whole negotiates contracts with the various theatrical unions and agreements with the guilds and co administers the Tony Awards with the American Theatre Wing a service organization While the League and the theatrical unions are sometimes at loggerheads during those periods when new contracts are being negotiated they also cooperate on many projects and events designed to promote professional theatre in New York br Of the four non profit theatre companies with Broadway theatres all four Lincoln Center Theater Manhattan Theatre Club Roundabout Theatre Company and Second Stage Theatre belong to the League of Resident Theatres and have contracts with the theatrical unions which are negotiated separately from the other Broadway theatre and producers Disney also negotiates apart from the League as did Livent before it closed down its operations br The majority of Broadway theatres are owned or managed by three organizations the Shubert Organization a for profit arm of the non profit Shubert Foundation which owns seventeen theatres the Nederlander Organization which controls nine theatres and ATG Entertainment which owns seven Broadway houses br br Both musicals and straight plays on Broadway often rely on casting well known performers in leading roles to draw larger audiences or bring in new audience members to the theatre Actors from film and television are frequently cast for the revivals of Broadway shows or are used to replace actors leaving a cast There are still however performers who are primarily stage actors spending most of their time on the boards and appearing in screen roles only secondarily As Patrick Healy of The New York Times noted br br Broadway once had many homegrown stars who committed to working on a show for a year as Nathan Lane has for The Addams Family In some theater heavyweights like Mr Lane were not even nominated instead several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short timers on Broadway given that many of their film star performers had to move on to other commitments br According to Mark Shenton One of the biggest changes to the commercial theatrical landscape on both sides of the Atlantic over the past decade or so is that sightings of big star names turning out to do plays has sic gone up but the runs they are prepared to commit to has gone down Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months and perhaps a year now the week run is the norm br The minimum size of the Broadway orchestra is governed by an agreement with the musicians union Local American Federation of Musicians and The Broadway League For example the agreement specifies the minimum size of the orchestra at the Minskoff Theatre to be eighteen while at the Music Box Theatre it is nine br br Most Broadway shows are commercial productions intended to make a profit for the producers and investors backers or angels and therefore have open ended runs duration that the production plays meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand but depends on critical response word of mouth and the effectiveness of the show s advertising all of which determine ticket sales Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk Shows need not make a profit immediately should they make their nut weekly operating expenses or lose money at a rate acceptable to the producers they may continue to run in the expectation that eventually they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable In some borderline situations producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived or even that performers with the permission of their unions take reduced salaries to prevent a show from closing Theatre owners who are not generally profit participants in most productions may waive or reduce rents or even lend money to a show to keep it running br Some Broadway shows are produced by non commercial organizations as part of a regular subscription season Lincoln Center Theatre Roundabout Theatre Company Manhattan Theatre Club and Second Stage Theater are the four non profit theatre companies that currently have permanent Broadway venues Some other productions are produced on Broadway with limited engagement runs for several reasons including financial issues prior engagements of the performers or temporary availability of a theatre between the end of one production and the beginning of another However some shows with planned limited engagement runs may after critical acclaim or box office success extend their engagements or convert to open ended runs This was the case with s August Osage County s God of Carnage s Newsies and s Take Me Out br Historically musicals on Broadway tend to have longer runs than straight i e non musical plays On January The Phantom of the Opera at the Majestic Theatre became the longest running Broadway musical with performances overtaking Cats The Phantom of the Opera closed on Broadway on April soon after celebrating its th anniversary after a total of performances br br Attending a Broadway show is a common tourist activity in New York The TKTS booths sell same day tickets and in certain cases next day matinee tickets for many Broadway and Off Broadway shows at a discount of to The TKTS booths are located in Times Square in Lower Manhattan and at Lincoln Center This service is run by Theatre Development Fund Many Broadway theatres also offer special student rates same day rush or lottery tickets or standing room tickets to help ensure that their theatres are as full and their grosses as high as possible br According to The Broadway League total Broadway attendance was million in compared to million in The average age of the Broadway audience in the theater season was the lowest it had been in nearly two decades By about of Broadway tickets were sold to international visitors although many visitors reported not being able to use their tickets In the first full season since the COVID pandemic Broadway theaters sold million tickets of which were to local residents and to international visitors At the time the average age of theatergoers was nearly two thirds of the audience were women and identified as a racial minority br br The classification of theatres is governed by language in Actors Equity Association contracts To be eligible for a Tony a production must be in a house with seats or more and in the Theater District which are the criteria that define Broadway theatre Off Broadway and off off Broadway shows often provide a more experimental challenging and intimate performance than is possible in the larger Broadway theatres Some Broadway shows however such as the musicals Hair Little Shop of Horrors Spring Awakening Next to Normal Rent Avenue Q In the Heights Fun Home A Chorus Line Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton began their runs Off Broadway and later transferred to Broadway seeking to replicate their intimate experience in a larger theatre Other productions are first developed through workshops and then out of town tryouts before transferring to Broadway Merrily We Roll Along famously skipped an out of town tryout and attempted to do an in town tryout actually preview performances on Broadway before its official opening with disastrous results br br After or even during successful runs in Broadway theatres producers often remount their productions with new casts and crew for the Broadway national tour which travels to theatres in major cities across the country Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway the entire production with most if not all of the original cast intact is relaunched as a touring company hence the name Broadway national tour Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time whether the show is still running in New York or not with many companies sitting down in other major cities for their own extended runs For Broadway national tours of top tier cities the entire Broadway production is transplanted almost entirely intact and may run for many months or years at each stop For example the first U S tour of The Phantom of the Opera required foot long m semi trailers to transport all its sets equipment and costumes and it took almost days to properly unload all those trucks and install everything into a theater br Second tier and smaller cities can also attract national tours but these are more likely to be bus and truck tours These are scaled down versions of the larger national touring productions historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air while the sets and equipment traveled by truck Tours of this type often run for weeks rather than months and frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules and to fit into fewer trucks A typical second tier city can usually sell only up to about eight shows one week of tickets For cities smaller than that a touring production might move twice a week split weeks or every day one nighters For bus and truck tours the production values are usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production and the actors while still members of the actors union are compensated under a different less lucrative union contract The Touring Broadway Awards presented by The Broadway League honored excellence in touring Broadway br br Broadway productions and artists are honored by the annual Antoinette Perry Awards commonly called the Tony Awards or Tonys given by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League and that were first presented in The Tony is Broadway s most prestigious award comparable to the Academy Awards for Hollywood film productions Their importance has increased since when the awards presentation show began to be broadcast on national television In a strategy to improve the television ratings celebrities are often chosen to host the show some with scant connection to the theatre The most recent Tony Awards ceremony was held on June Other awards given to Broadway productions include the Drama Desk Award presented since the New York Drama Critics Circle Awards first given in and the Outer Critics Circle Award initially presented in br br An after the opening date indicates that the
