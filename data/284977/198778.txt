id: 198778
A composer is a person who writes music The term is especially used to indicate composers of Western classical music or those who are composers by occupation Many composers are or were also skilled performers of music br br br Etymology and definition br br The term is descended from Latin comp n literally one who puts together The earliest use of the term in a musical context given by the Oxford English Dictionary is from Thomas Morley s A Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music where he says Some wil sic be good descanters and yet wil be but bad composers br Composer is a loose term that generally refers to any person who writes music More specifically it is often used to denote people who are composers by occupation or those who work in the tradition of Western classical music Writers of exclusively or primarily songs may be called composers but since the th century the terms songwriter or singer songwriter are more often used particularly in popular music genres In other contexts the term composer can refer to a literary writer or more rarely and generally someone who combines pieces into a whole br Across cultures and traditions composers may write and transmit music in a variety of ways In much popular music the composer writes a composition and it is then transmitted via oral tradition Conversely in some Western classical traditions music may be composed aurally i e in the mind of the musician and subsequently written and passed through written documents br br br Role in the Western world br br br Relationship with performers br In the development of European classical music the function of composing music initially did not have much greater importance than that of performing it The preservation of individual compositions did not receive enormous attention and musicians generally had no qualms about modifying compositions for performance br In the Western world before the Romantic period of the th century composition almost always went side by side with a combination of either singing instructing and theorizing br Even in a conventional Western piece of instrumental music in which all of the melodies chords and basslines are written out in musical notation the performer has a degree of latitude to add artistic interpretation to the work by such means as by varying their articulation and phrasing choosing how long to make fermatas held notes or pauses and in the case of bowed string instruments woodwinds or brass instruments deciding whether to use expressive effects such as vibrato or portamento For a singer or instrumental performer the process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed interpretation Different performers interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or phrasing of the melodies Composers and songwriters who present their music are interpreting just as much as those who perform the music of others The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer br Although a musical composition often has a single author this is not always the case A work of music can have multiple composers which often occurs in popular music when a band collaborates to write a song or in musical theatre where the songs may be written by one person the orchestration of the accompaniment parts and writing of the overture is done by an orchestrator and the words may be written by a third person br A piece of music can also be composed with words images or in the th and st centuries computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds Examples of this range from wind chimes jingling in a breeze to avant garde music from the th century that uses graphic notation to text compositions such as Aus den Sieben Tagen to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the th century such as John Cage Morton Feldman and Witold Lutos awski br The nature and means of individual variation of the music are varied depending on the musical culture in the country and the time period it was written For instance music composed in the Baroque era particularly in slow tempos often was written in bare outline with the expectation that the performer would add improvised ornaments to the melody line during a performance Such freedom generally diminished in later eras correlating with the increased use by composers of more detailed scoring in the form of dynamics articulation et cetera composers became uniformly more explicit in how they wished their music to be interpreted although how strictly and minutely these are dictated varies from one composer to another Because of this trend of composers becoming increasingly specific and detailed in their instructions to the performer a culture eventually developed whereby faithfulness to the composer s written intention came to be highly valued see for example Urtext edition This musical culture is almost certainly related to the high esteem bordering on veneration in which the leading classical composers are often held by performers br The historically informed performance movement has revived to some extent the possibility of the performer elaborating seriously the music as given in the score particularly for Baroque music and music from the early Classical period The movement might be considered a way of creating greater faithfulness to the original in works composed at a time that expected performers to improvise In genres other than classical music the performer generally has more freedom thus for instance when a performer of Western popular music creates a cover of an earlier song there is little expectation of exact rendition of the original nor is exact faithfulness necessarily highly valued with the possible exception of note for note transcriptions of famous guitar solos br In Western art music the composer typically orchestrates their compositions but in musical theatre and pop music songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration In some cases a pop songwriter may not use notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play or record it from memory In jazz and popular music notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by the examination of methods and practice of Western classical music but the definition of composition is broad enough for the creation of popular and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers br br br History of employment br During the Middle Ages most composers worked for the Catholic church and composed music for religious services such as plainchant melodies During the Renaissance music era composers typically worked for aristocratic employers While aristocrats typically required composers to produce a significant amount of religious music such as Masses composers also penned many non religious songs on the topic of courtly love the respectful reverential love of a great woman from afar Courtly love songs were very popular during the Renaissance era During the Baroque music era many composers were employed by aristocrats or as church employees During the Classical period composers began to organize more public concerts for profit which helped composers to be less dependent on aristocratic or church jobs This trend continued in the Romantic music era in the th century In the th century composers began to seek employment as professors in universities and conservatories In the th century composers also earned money from the sales of their works such as sheet music publications of their songs or pieces or as sound recordings of their works br br br Role of women br br In American musicologist Marcia Citron asked Why is music composed by women so marginal to the standard classical repertoire Citron examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received canon of performed musical works She argues that in the s women composers typically wrote art songs for performance in small recitals rather than symphonies intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers since women composers did not write many symphonies they were deemed to be not notable as composers br According to Abbey Philips women musicians have had a very difficult time breaking through and getting the credit they deserve During the Medieval eras most of the art music was created for liturgical religious purposes and due to the views about the roles of women that were held by religious leaders few women composed this type of music with the nun Hildegard von Bingen being among the exceptions Most university textbooks on the history of music discuss almost exclusively the role of male composers As well very few works by women composers are part of the standard repertoire of classical music In Concise Oxford History of Music Clara Shumann sic is one of the only female composers mentioned but other notable women composers of the common practice period include Fanny Mendelssohn and C cile Chaminade and arguably the most influential teacher of composers during the mid th century was Nadia Boulanger Philips states that d uring the th century the women who were composing playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts br Women today are being taken more seriously in the realm of concert music though the statistics of recognition prizes employment and overall opportunities are still biased toward men br br br Clustering br Famous composers have a tendency to cluster in specific cities throughout history Based on over prominent composers listed in Grove Music Online and using word count measurement techniques the most important cities for classical music can be quantitatively identified br Paris has been the main hub for western classical music in all periods It was ranked fifth in the th and th centuries but first in the th to th centuries inclusive London was the second most meaningful city eighth in the th century seventh in the th fifth in the th second in the th and th centuries and fourth in the th century Rome topped the rankings in the th century dropped to second in the th and th centuries eighth in the th century ninth in the th century but back at sixth in the th century Berlin appears in the top ten rankings only in the th century and was ranked third most important city in both the th and th centuries New York City entered the rankings in the th century in fifth place and stood at second rank in the th century The patterns are very similar for a sample of top composers br br br Modern training br Professional classical composers often have a background in performing classical music during their childhood and teens either as a singer in a choir as a player in a youth orchestra or as a performer on a solo instrument e g piano pipe organ or violin Teens aspiring to be composers can continue their postsecondary studies in a variety of formal training settings including colleges conservatories and universities Conservatories which are the standard musical training system in countries such as France and Canada provide lessons and amateur orchestral and choral singing experience for composition students Universities offer a range of composition programs including bachelor s degrees Master of Music degrees and Doctor of Musical Arts degrees As well there are a variety of other training programs such as classical summer camps and festivals which give students the opportunity to get coaching from composers br br br Undergraduate br Bachelor s degrees in composition referred to as B Mus or B M are four year programs that include individual composition lessons amateur orchestra choral experience and a sequence of courses in music history music theory and liberal arts courses e g English literature which give the student a more well rounded education Usually composition students must complete significant pieces or songs before graduating Not all composers hold a B Mus in composition composers may also hold a B Mus in music performance or music theory br br br Masters br Master of Music degrees M mus in composition consists of private lessons with a composition professor ensemble experience and graduate courses in music history and music theory along with one or two concerts featuring the composition student s pieces A master s degree in music referred to as an M Mus or M M is often a required minimum credential for people who wish to teach composition at a university or conservatory A composer with an M Mus could be an adjunct professor or instructor at a university but it would be difficult in the s to obtain a tenure track professor position with this degree br br br Doctoral br To become a tenure track professor many universities require a doctoral degree In composition the key doctoral degree is the Doctor of Musical Arts rather than the PhD the PhD is awarded in music but typically for subjects such as musicology and music theory br Doctor of Musical Arts referred to as D M A DMA D Mus A or A Mus D degrees in composition provide an opportunity for advanced study at the highest artistic and pedagogical level requiring usually an additional credit hours beyond a master s degree which is about credits beyond a bachelor s degree For this reason admission is highly selective Students must submit examples of their compositions If available some schools will also accept video or audio recordings of performances of the student s pieces Examinations in music history music theory ear training dictation and an entrance examination are required br Students must prepare significant compositions under the guidance of faculty composition professors Some schools require DMA composition students to present concerts of their works which are typically performed by singers or musicians from the school The completion of advanced coursework and a minimum B average are other typical requirements of a D M A program During a D M A program a composition student may get experience teaching undergraduate music students br br br Other routes br Some composers did not complete composition programs but focused their studies on the performance of voice or an instrument or on music theory and developed their compositional skills over the course of a career in another musical occupation br br br br br br Citations br br br General and cited sources br Everist Mark Introduction In Everist Mark ed The
