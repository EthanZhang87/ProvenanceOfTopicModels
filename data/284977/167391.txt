performed in a call and response fashion heavily influenced by ancestral African music Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment Most of the singing was done a cappella The first published use of the term gospel song appeared in br The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F Root Philip Bliss Charles H Gabriel William Howard Doane and Fanny Crosby Gospel music publishing houses emerged The advent of radio in the s greatly increased the audience for gospel music Following World War II gospel music moved into major auditoriums and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate br Black and Southern gospel music are largely responsible for gospel s continued presence in contemporary Christian music with soul music by far the best known popular music variant The styles emerged from the African American music and American folk music traditions and have evolved in various ways over the years continuing to form the basis of Black church worship even today It has also come to be used in churches of various other cultural traditions especially within Pentecostalism and via the gospel choir phenomenon spearheaded by Thomas Dorsey has become a form of musical devotion worldwide Southern used all male tenor lead baritone bass quartets Progressive Southern gospel has grown out of Southern gospel over the past couple of decades Christian country music sometimes referred to as country gospel music is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair It peaked in popularity in the mid s Bluegrass gospel music is rooted in American mountain music Celtic gospel music infuses gospel music with a Celtic flair and is quite popular in countries such as Ireland British black gospel refers to Gospel music of the African diaspora produced in the United Kingdom br br According to Yale University music professor Willie Ruff the singing of psalms in Scottish Gaelic by Presbyterians of the Scottish Hebrides evolved from lining out where one person sang a solo and others followed into the call and response of gospel music of the American South Another theory notes foundations in the works of Isaac Watts and others br Moreover the genre arose during a time when literacy was not a guarantee utilizing a great deal of repetition which unlike more traditional hymns allowed those who could not read the opportunity to participate br br Perhaps the most famous gospel based hymns were composed in the s and s by English writers John Newton Amazing Grace and Augustus Toplady Rock of Ages members of the Anglican Church Starting out as lyrics only it took decades for standardized tunes to be added to them Although not directly connected with African American gospel music they were adopted by African Americans as well as white Americans and Newton s connection with the abolition movement provided cross fertilization br br The first published use of the term Gospel song probably appeared in when Philip Bliss released a songbook entitled Gospel Songs A Choice Collection of Hymns and Tunes It was used to describe a new style of church music songs that were easy to grasp and more easily singable than the traditional church hymns which came out of the mass revival movement starting with Dwight L Moody whose musician was Ira D Sankey as well as the Holiness Pentecostal movement Prior to the meeting of Moody and Sankey in there was an American rural frontier history of revival and camp meeting songs but the gospel hymn was of a different character and it served the needs of mass revivals in the great cities br The revival movement employed popular singers and song leaders the most famous of them being Ira D Sankey The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F Root Philip Bliss Charles H Gabriel William Howard Doane and Fanny Crosby As an extension to his initial publication Gospel Songs Philip Bliss in collaboration with Ira D Sankey issued no s to of Gospel Hymns in Sankey and Bliss s collection can be found in many libraries today br The popularity of revival singers and the openness of rural churches to this type of music in spite of its initial use in city revivals led to the late th and early th century establishment of gospel music publishing houses such as those of Homer Rodeheaver E O Excell Charlie Tillman and Charles Tindley These publishers were in the market for large quantities of new music providing an outlet for the creative work of many songwriters and composers br The advent of radio in the s greatly increased the audience for gospel music and James D Vaughan used radio as an integral part of his business model which also included traveling quartets to publicize the gospel music books he published several times a year Virgil O Stamps and Jesse R Baxter studied Vaughan s business model and by the late s were running heavy competition for Vaughan The s also saw the marketing of gospel records by groups such as the Carter Family br br The Pentecostal movement quickly made inroads with churches not attuned to the Europeanized Black church music that had become popular over the years since Emancipation These congregations readily adopted and contributed to the gospel music publications of the early th century Sister Rosetta Tharpe pioneer of rock and roll soon emerged from this tradition as the first great gospel recording artist The first person to introduce ragtime to gospel and the first to play piano on a gospel recording was Arizona Dranes br The s saw the rise of Black gospel quartets such as the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama In addition to these high profile quartets there were many Black gospel musicians performing in the s and s usually playing the guitar and singing in the streets of Southern cities br In the s in Chicago Thomas A Dorsey turned to gospel music establishing a publishing house It has been said that was the year traditional black gospel music began as the National Baptist Convention first publicly endorsed the music at its meeting Dorsey was responsible for developing the musical careers of many African American artists such as Mahalia Jackson best known for her rendition of his Precious Lord Take My Hand br Meanwhile radio continued to develop an audience for gospel music a fact that was commemorated in Albert E Brumley s song Turn Your Radio On which is still being published in gospel song books In a recording of Turn Your Radio On by the Lewis Family was nominated for Gospel Song of the Year br In the Gospel Music Association was established which in turn began the Dove Awards in and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in Both of the latter two groups began primarily for Southern gospel performers but in the late s began including artists of other subgenres which brought in many Black artists Also in James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America a Black gospel outlet br Late th century musicians such as Elvis Presley Jerry Lee Lewis and the Blackwood Brothers were also known for their gospel influences and recordings br br Urban contemporary gospel emerged in the late s and early s with Walter Hawkins highly popular Oh Happy Day which is still performed worldwide in the Artists such as James Cleveland Aretha Franklin the Clark Sisters Andra Crouch and Richard Smallwood followed crossing over musically and gaining notoriety and this pattern would repeat itself in subsequent decades with new artists like Yolanda Adams and Kirk Franklin making increasingly more bold forays into the secular world with their musical stylings The current sphere of Black gospel recording artists is almost exclusively of the urban contemporary bent br Also of note is the rise of Christian or gospel rap hip hop which has gained increasing popularity since the days of the Gospel Gangstaz and The Cross Movement Often considered a subgenre of urban contemporary gospel Christian rap has become dominated in present times by artists from Reach Records who have seen perhaps the most commercial success of any artists in the gospel genre Lecrae the label s founder and preeminent artist has charted in the top of on the Billboard three times with his album Anomaly debuting at No br br Traditional Black gospel music is the most well known form often seen in Black churches non Black Pentecostal and evangelical churches and in entertainment spaces across the country and world It originates from the Southeastern United States the South where most Black Americans lived prior to the Great Migration This music was highly influenced by the hymnody of the spirituals and of Watts and later the musical style and vision of Dorsey Whereas northern Black churches did not at first welcome Dorsey s music having become accustomed to their own more Eurocentric flavorings after the Southern migrants new churches became more popular so did gospel music gospel choirs and the general trend toward exclusive use of this music in Black churches Dorsey Mahalia Jackson the Mississippi Mass Choir and the Georgia Mass Choir are but a few notable examples br br Developing out of the fusion of traditional Black gospel with the styles of secular Black music popular in the s and s Urban Contemporary gospel is the most common form of recorded gospel music today It relies heavily on rhythms and instrumentation common in the secular music of the contemporary era often including the use of electronic beats while still incorporating the themes and heritage of the traditional Black gospel genre Kirk Franklin is the foremost and by far the bestselling individual in this genre while Andrae Crouch the Clark Sisters and Yolanda Adams are also very popular and noteworthy br br British black gospel refers to gospel music of the African diaspora in the UK It is also often referred to as UK gospel The distinctive sound is heavily influenced by UK street culture with many artists from the African and Caribbean majority black churches in the UK The genre has gained recognition in various awards such as the GEM Gospel Entertainment Music Awards MOBO Awards Urban Music Awards and has its own Official Christian Gospel Albums Chart br br Southern gospel music comes from the Southeastern United States and is similar in sound to Christian country music but it sometimes known as quartet music for its traditional four men and a piano set up The genre while remaining predominantly White began to integrate Black gospel stylings in the s It has evolved over the years into a popular form of music across the United States and overseas especially among baby boomers and those living in the South Like other forms of music the creation performance significance and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to culture and social context It is composed and performed for many purposes ranging from aesthetic pleasure religious or ceremonial purposes or as an entertainment product for the marketplace br br Christian country music sometimes referred to as country gospel music is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair is also known as inspirational country Christian country over the years has progressed into a mainstream country sound with inspirational or positive country lyrics In the mid s Christian country hit its highest popularity This popularity was such that mainstream artists like Larry Gatlin Charlie Daniels and Barbara Mandrell just to name a few began recording music that had this positive Christian country flair These mainstream artists have now become award winners in this genre br br Some proponents of standard hymns generally dislike gospel music of the late th and early th centuries believing that it emphasizes emotion over doctrine For example Patrick and Sydnor complain that commercial success led to a proliferation of such music and deterioration even in a standard which to begin with was not high resulted They went on to say there is no doubt that a deterioration in taste follows the use of this type of hymn and tune it fosters an attachment to the trivial and sensational which dulls and often destroys sense of the dignity and beauty which best befit the song that is used in the service of God br Gold reviewed the issue in and collected a number of quotations similar to the complaints of Patrick and Sydnor However he also provided this quotation Gospel hymnody has the distinction of being America s most typical contribution to Christian song As such it is valid in its inspiration and in its employment br Today with historical distance there is a greater acceptance of such gospel songs into official denominational hymnals For example the United Methodist Church made this acceptance explicit in The Faith We Sing a supplement to the official denominational hymnal In the preface the editors say Experience has shown that some older treasures were missed when the current hymnals were compiled br br Gospel Music Hall of Fame br List of gospel musicians br Phillip Paul Bliss House br Soul music br Stellar Awards br br Christ Janer
