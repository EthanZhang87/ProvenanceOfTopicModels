Doris Day Peggy Lee Pat Suzuki and Phranc and it has been used in other movies and shows and Love Look Away was recorded by Tony Bennett br Compared with the Broadway musical on which it is based the film rearranged the order of the songs According to David Henry Hwang the song Like a God was dropped from the film because studio executives were worried it could offend audiences in the American South Alfred Newman the film s music supervisor and score conductor wrote a letter to producer Ross Hunter protesting the excision of music arrangers from the credits during post production Hunter agreed to reinsert a credit for Ken Darby the associate music supervisor br br br Soundtrack br br The soundtrack album from the film was critically praised Variety lauded Newman s rousing orchestration Shortly after its release by Decca Records both the monaural and stereo versions of the soundtrack charted on the list of bestselling records according to Billboard s Top LP s list For the film soundtrack album the performers were credited by role not name since several of the performers in the movie don t do their own singing The singing voice of the character Linda Low portrayed by Nancy Kwan was dubbed by B J Baker a white studio singer who had worked with Elvis Presley Frank Sinatra Bobby Darin The Righteous Brothers and Sam Cooke br The torch song Love Look Away sung by Helen Chao portrayed by Reiko Sato was dubbed in by the American opera singer Marilyn Horne who was offered the job by Alfred Newman after Horne s triumphant d but with the San Francisco Opera in Wozzeck Horne and Newman were friends through her extensive background singing on film soundtracks In addition Dr Han Li portrayed by Kam Tong is dubbed by John Dodson br The film soundtrack was reissued on CD by Decca Broadway on September which added a bonus track of Love Look Away recorded by Rosemary Clooney around br br br Production br After the novel was released and became a bestseller options were offered to author C Y Lee to produce a movie or stage adaptation Lee was torn between the movie offer which was more lucrative at but would force him to give up all rights or the stage offer from Joseph Fields which only gave him but only relinquished stage rights After getting drunk the night of the decision Lee could not remember the offer he chose but his agent congratulated him on making the right choice the next morning It turns out Lee had chosen the offer from Fields who initially wanted to produce a play and eventually a movie but after Fields mentioned the novel to Rodgers and Hammerstein they signed on to write the musical br The film adaptation of Flower Drum Song was produced by Universal Studios a break for Rodgers and Hammerstein who had previously had their films produced by Twentieth Century Fox The screenplay was written by Joseph Fields who had previously collaborated with Hammerstein on the libretto for the musical but had not previously written a major musical film likewise the director Henry Koster and producer Ross Hunter were working on their first musical feature film San Francisco watercolorist Dong Kingman painted the opening title sequence which traces the journey of Mei Li from Hong Kong Hermes Pan provided the choreography Principal photography began on March the film was largely shot at Stage of the Universal Studios Lot on a sq ft m set built to reproduce Chinatown including the opening scenes at Saint Mary s Square complete with a replica of the stainless steel statue of Sun Yat Sen sculpted by Beniamino Bufano at a cost of br br br Casting br The film was the first to feature a cast almost entirely consisting of Asian Americans one of the few speaking white parts being that of a mugger including dancers though three of the singers used for dubbing were not Asian At the time the practice of yellowface was more common than Asian actors playing Asian roles see Examples of yellowface br Starring in the movie were Nancy Kwan James Shigeta Benson Fong James Hong Reiko Sato Victor Sen Yung and the original Broadway cast members Jack Soo Miyoshi Umeki and Juanita Hall an African American actress who had previously played the Tonkinese Bloody Mary in the Broadway and film productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein s South Pacific br For an episode of the contemporary TV show Wagon Train white actor Arnold Stang was cast in yellowface wearing rubber eyelids For this casting decision the reason given was that all of Hollywood s Oriental actors were busy making Flower Drum Song br Anna May Wong had been scheduled to play the part of Madam Liang but she died in February before production began Kwan was cast in the role of Linda Low when she met Ross Hunter the producer of Flower Drum Song at a party after he saw her film debut in the film adaptation of The World of Suzie Wong Kwan s hiring was announced in February br br br Changes from musical and novel br br Among changes for the film the song Like a God was changed from a song into a presentation of beat poetry The film and earlier stage version is lighter hearted than the novel upon which it is based For example while Helen is simply left alone and broken hearted in the musical and film versions Ta s rejection of her prompts her to commit suicide in the novel In the novel Mei Li does not arrive in Chinatown illegally nor does she have an arranged marriage with Sammy Fong the character was created for the musical and film br br br Filming locations br Although set in San Francisco only a few scenes were actually filmed on location including a scene with Kwan and Shigeta on Twin Peaks However neither Kwan nor Shigeta actually filmed at this location Doubles stood in for them for the long shots of the car arriving and leaving Twin Peaks The close ups of Kwan and Shigeta in the car were process shots filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood with the view from Twin Peaks projected on a screen behind them br The film includes scenes from the San Francisco Chinese New Year Festival and Parade br br br Awards and honors br br br Release br br Flower Drum Song premiered in New York City at Radio City Music Hall on November The initial plan was to have the premiere on November in San Francisco at the Golden Gate Theatre to benefit local hospitals including the San Francisco Chinese Hospital The Golden Gate Theatre premiere would be followed by a three day Flower Drum Festival in Chinatown A private screening was held for President John F Kennedy and his family at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port on November The film was widely released near Christmas br It has been asserted the film was the only Hollywood adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to lose money The production rights were reported as costing million and the budget was million while gross revenues have been reported as million Since half of gross revenues are actually returned as rentals to the studio and since movies at the time needed to make back at least twice their production and advertising budgets to be profitable the movie s million rental return was a loss for the studio br br br Reception br Reviewing for The New York Times after the premiere Bosley Crowther called the film neither subtle or fragile It is gaudy and gaggy and quite melodic Life called it gay tuneful and well worth the admission However Variety thought that much of the fundamental charm grace and novelty of Rodgers Hammerstein s Flower Drum Song has been overwhelmed by the sheer opulence and glamour of the film br br David H Lewis in called it a bizarre pastiche of limping mediocracy He comments that since the version of the musical was only rarely revived for decades after its initial run the film would in future years come to stand for the stage musical it so crassly misrepresented and would serve as the version that academics and latter day theatre critics would judge when they analyzed the musical James Deaville countered that Koster and Hunter wanted to make the musical more relevant and accessible by intensify ing the generational conflict and required spelling out much that the musical left to the audience s imagination br Some Asian Americans have found the film offensive in later years due to common stereotypes and what was seen as miscasting Japanese American actors Shigeta and Umeki in Chinese American roles David Henry Hwang who revised the musical for a revival had a secret soft spot for the movie version It was kind of a guilty pleasure and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen singing and dancing and cracking jokes Writer Joanna Lee praised the film s portrayal of Asian Americans as prominent and legitimate American citizens br On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes of critics reviews are positive with an average rating of The website s consensus reads Flower Drum Song s story may be somewhat skimpy but this Rodgers and Hammerstein adaptation blooms with brilliant songs and choreography br br br Home media br The film was first issued on VHS in then reissued in followed by a LaserDisc version in by MCA Home Video The LaserDisc and VHS versions of the film were cropped to a ratio using pan and scan with the exception of the I Enjoy Being a Girl sequence After the VHS and LaserDisc versions went out of print the film was unavailable on home media for many years while most of the other video versions of Rodgers and Hammerstein movies were released on DVD by other
