title: Flower Drum Song
id: 455616
Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein It is based on the novel The Flower Drum Song by Chinese American author C Y Lee It premiered on Broadway in and was then performed in the West End and on tour It was adapted for a musical film br After their extraordinary early successes beginning with Oklahoma in Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written two musicals in the s that did not do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes Lee s novel focuses on a father Wang Chi yang a wealthy refugee from China who clings to traditional values in San Francisco s Chinatown Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of the musical to his son Wang Ta who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian or at least plausibly Asian looking cast The musical more light hearted than Lee s novel was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour br After the release of the film version the musical was rarely produced as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed When it was put on the stage lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut The piece did not return to Broadway until when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang but retaining most of the original songs was presented after a successful Los Angeles run Hwang s story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter generational and immigrant themes and emphasizes the romantic relationships It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally br br br Background br br br Novel br br C Y Lee fled war torn China in the s and came to the United States where he attended Yale University s playwriting program graduating in with an M F A degree By the s he was barely making a living writing short stories and working as a Chinese teacher translator and journalist for San Francisco Chinatown newspapers He had hoped to break into playwriting but instead wrote a novel about Chinatown The Flower Drum Song originally titled Grant Avenue Lee initially had no success selling his novel but his agent submitted it to the publishing house of Farrar Straus and Cudahy The firm sent the manuscript to an elderly reader for evaluation The reader was found dead in bed the manuscript beside him with the words Read this scrawled on it The publishing house did and bought Lee s novel which became a bestseller in br Lee s novel centers on Wang Chi yang a year old man who fled China to avoid the communists The wealthy refugee lives in a house in Chinatown with his two sons His sister in law Madam Tang who takes citizenship classes is a regular visitor and urges Wang to adopt Western ways While his sons and sister in law are integrating into American culture Wang stubbornly resists assimilation and speaks only two words of English Yes and No Wang also has a severe cough which he does not wish to have cured feeling that it gives him authority in his household Wang s elder son Wang Ta woos Linda Tung but on learning that she has many men in her life drops her he later learns she is a nightclub dancer Linda s friend seamstress Helen Chao who has been unable to find a man despite the shortage of eligible women in Chinatown gets Ta drunk and seduces him On awakening in her bed he agrees to an affair but eventually abandons her and she commits suicide br Impatient at Ta s inability to find a wife Wang arranges for a picture bride for his son However before the picture bride arrives Ta meets a young woman May Li who with her father has recently come to San Francisco The two support themselves by singing depressing flower drum songs on the street Ta invites the two into the Wang household with his father s approval and he and May Li fall in love He vows to marry her after she is falsely accused by the household servants of stealing a clock though his father forbids it Wang struggles to understand the conflicts that have torn his household apart his hostility toward assimilation is isolating him from his family In the end taking his son s advice Wang decides not to go to the herbalist to seek a remedy for his cough but walks to a Chinese run Western clinic symbolizing that he is beginning to accept American culture br br br Genesis of the musical br br Rodgers and Hammerstein despite extraordinary successes earlier in their partnership such as Oklahoma Carousel and South Pacific had suffered back to back Broadway relative failures in the mid s with Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream While Oklahoma had broken new ground in any new project in the late s would have to compete with modern musicals and techniques like the brutal realism in West Side Story and with other Broadway musical hits such as The Music Man My Fair Lady and The Pajama Game Rodgers and Hammerstein had made it their rule to begin work on their next musical as soon as the last opened on Broadway but by the start of six months after Pipe Dream closed the pair had no new stage musical in prospect They had however been working since on the popular television version of Cinderella which was broadcast on CBS on March Rodgers was still recovering from an operation for cancer in a tooth socket and he was drinking heavily and suffering from depression In June Rodgers checked himself into Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic and he remained there for twelve weeks According to his daughters Mary and Linda this did not put a stop to his drinking br Hammerstein meanwhile was in Los Angeles at the filming of South Pacific While at the commissary he met longtime friend Joe Fields who mentioned that he was negotiating for the rights to The Flower Drum Song Intrigued by the title Hammerstein asked for a copy of the novel and decided that it had potential as a musical the lyricist described it as sort of a Chinese Life with Father Hammerstein consulted with Rodgers and they agreed to make it their next work to be written and produced in association with Fields Hammerstein began work in mid In July however he fell ill and was hospitalized for a month This forced him to hurry his writing as the production team had hoped to have the show in rehearsal by the start of September this was postponed by two weeks In interviews however Hammerstein pointed out that he had when necessary written songs for previous shows while in rehearsals for them br The musical retained Lee s central theme a theme coursing through much th century American literature the conflict between Old World immigrants and their New World offspring Hammerstein and Fields shifted the focus of the story however from the elder Wang who is central to Lee s novel to his son Ta They also removed darker elements of Lee s work including Helen Chao s suicide after her desperate fling with Ta added the festive nightclub subplot and emphasized the romantic elements of the story This made the musical more lighthearted and comedic than the novel According to David Lewis in his book about the musical Mr Hammerstein and his colleagues were evidently in no mood to write a musical drama or even to invest their comedic approach with dramatic counterpoint of the sort that Jud Fry had given Oklahoma They took the safest commercial route by following the eldest son s search for love the most popular theme at the time with Broadway audiences Lewis notes that Chao s role though diminished in the musical nevertheless gives it some of its darkest moments and she serves much the same purpose as Jud Fry to be in Hammerstein s words the bass fiddle that gives body to the orchestration of the story Though the new story was less artistically adventurous than the earlier Rodgers and Hammerstein hits it was innovative even daring in its treatment of Asian Americans an ethnic group that had long been harshly caricatured and marginalized in our mainstream pop culture br br br plot br br Act I br Wang Ta a young Chinese American man living in his father s house in San Francisco s Chinatown discusses the problems of finding a wife with his aunt Madam Liang You Are Beautiful before hurrying off on a blind date Nightclub owner Sammy Fong arrives with an offer for Ta s immigrant father Master Wang a very old fashioned Chinatown elder Sammy s picture bride has just arrived from China illegally but the shy Mei Li is clearly the wrong girl for Sammy who already has an assertive girlfriend a characteristic he likes Sammy offers to sign the contract over to the Wang family this would free Sammy from the contract and arrange a suitable wife for Ta Sammy has taken the liberty of bringing the girl and her father with him Wang is charmed A Hundred Million Miracles and invites them to live in his home on the understanding that if the proposed marriage falls through Fong will still be bound to marry Mei Li br Ta s blind date proves to be the thoroughly Americanized Linda Low who we will learn is Sammy Fong s girlfriend and a stripper at his club On the date with Ta I Enjoy Being a Girl Linda lies to Ta about her career and family Ta knowing that Chinese Americans with college degrees find it hard to get a job befitting their education plans to go to law school postponing the likely career struggle by three years The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him She agrees but she needs family consent and lies saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage Ta returns home and meets Mei Li who is immediately attracted to him I Am Going to Like It Here though Ta is unimpressed That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress Like a God br Linda comes to Madam Liang s graduation party from citizenship school with Linda s brother actually the comedian from Sammy s nightclub and presents herself as Ta s intended with her brother giving his consent for the marriage The extroverted Americanized woman is not what Wang has in mind for his elder son and Wang and Ta argue Sammy Fong arrives and quickly penetrates Linda s scheme Linda frustrated by the five years she has been seeing Sammy is determined to marry someone and if Sammy won t step forward she will settle for Ta Sammy quickly strikes back by inviting the Wangs Mei Li and her father to watch the show at his Celestial Bar Fan Tan Fannie Linda does her striptease realizing too late who is sitting at the best table Sammy s special guests storm out except for Ta who is so humiliated that he does not know what to do He is led away by childhood friend Helen Chao a seamstress who fits Linda s costumes for her and whose love for Ta is unrequited Linda goaded beyond endurance when Sammy raises his glass to her dumps a champagne bucket over his head br Act II br The drunken Ta spends the night at Helen s apartment Ballet In the morning Mei Li delivers Master Wang s coat for Helen to mend and is distressed to see Ta s dinner jacket there Mei Li jumps to conclusions and leaves horrified Ta leaves the lonely Helen totally oblivious to her attempts to interest him Wang wants the bar and its evil spirits shut down his sister in law informs him that free enterprise cannot be shut down and the two wonder at the foibles of the younger generation The Other Generation Ta arrives home to admit that his father was right Mei Li is the girl for him But now Mei Li wants nothing to do with him and the Lis leave the Wang home Sammy Fong and Linda decide to get married Sunday but when he goes to the Three Family Association a benevolent association to announce Linda as his bride he finds Mei Li and her father there and the elders insist that he honor his betrothal to the immigrant girl br Ta brings Mei Li a wedding gift of a pair of his mother s earrings that she wore on her wedding day and tries unsuccessfully to hide the fact that he is now deeply in love with her The wedding procession moves down San Francisco s Grant Avenue with the bride heavily veiled carried on a sedan chair Wedding Parade Sammy drinks from the traditional wedding goblet then offers the goblet to his new bride Unveiled Mei Li confesses to Sammy s mother that she cannot marry Sammy as she is an illegal alien a tactic she learned by watching American television The contract is void and that gives both Sammy and Ta the opportunity to marry their true loves Linda and Mei Li br br br Casting and tryouts br According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest Rodgers Hammerstein and Fields had hoped to engage Yul Brynner as director Brynner who had gained fame in the team s hit The King and I was an accomplished director However he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth Century Fox Instead they hired actor and dancer Gene Kelly who had never directed on stage before Kelly felt that the work would not be one of Rodgers and Hammerstein s best but as long as I crammed the show brim full of every joke and gimmick in the book I could get it to work br br The three producers sought Chinese or at least Asian actors to fill the cast an idea that was at the time considered very risky In the s there were relatively few Asian American actors Rodgers believed that Asians avoided acting because of shyness Critics note in any case that Asian Americans had found few opportunities in mainstream theatre Joshua Logan recommended a young Japanese actress Miyoshi Umeki whom he had discovered and cast the previous year opposite Marlon Brando in the film Sayonara for which she won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar she was cast as Mei Li They cast Keye Luke well known as Charlie Chan s Number One Son as Master Wang Rodgers and Hammerstein considered young talent from The King and I who might fit the parts and came up with teenager Patrick Adiarte a Filipino American who had played several of the young princes as he grew up before finishing as the crown prince Chulalongkorn A talented dancer he was cast as Wang San Ta s thoroughly Americanized younger brother Pat Suzuki a Japanese American who had been interned during World War II was a recent arrival in New York who had made strong positive impressions for her singing on such television programs as The Tonight Show with Jack Paar and The Ed Sullivan Show She became the first Linda Low as Ta s nightclub love interest was renamed br The team found it difficult to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers especially in the chorus Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong Kelly and the show s choreographer Carol Haney journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent Agents were sent to other cities in Honolulu they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney who would originate Wang Ta Meanwhile in New York the three producers were visiting dance schools An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response No formal audition was held in San Francisco s Chinatown and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro Jack Suzuki who soon changed his name to Jack Soo who was cast as Frankie Wing comedian at Sammy Fong s Celestial Bar The role of Fong proved difficult to cast Initially it was given to Larry Storch a nightclub comic but during the Boston tryouts it was given to another Caucasian Larry Blyden who was married to Carol Haney the show s choreographer The role of Madam Liang Master Wang s sister in law fell to Juanita Hall a light skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese Vietnamese woman Bloody Mary in South Pacific Another African American performer Diahann Carroll was considered for the cast but not hired Rodgers later wrote what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences People want to believe what they see on a stage and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman in South Pacific Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared to meet you nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up br When rehearsals began in September Hammerstein was absent still recuperating from his surgery Rodgers was present but kept falling asleep Hammerstein was told by his son James that Kelly was ineffective as a director and began attending rehearsals A number of changes were made to the songs My Best Love a song for Master Wang was at first thought better suited to his sister in law but when Juanita Hall could not make it work the song was cut entirely Rodgers and Hammerstein transformed a song entitled She Is Beautiful into You Are Beautiful The team decided to include a song for Sammy Fong to explain to Mei Li that they should not wed In the span of a few hours they wrote the lyrics and music to Don t Marry Me Once the songs were finalized Robert Russell Bennett who had orchestrated several of the creators most successful previous shows did the same for the score of Flower Drum Song br The musical opened for tryouts on October at Boston s Shubert Theatre The audience gave it an enthusiastic response causing Rodgers to leave his seat repeatedly and race to the back of the theatre looking for someone to hug The Boston critics thought well of the work stating that after the show was polished it was likely to be a hit Shortly after the Boston opening Fields suffered a heart attack and after his release from the hospital he had to return to New York to recuperate Author C Y Lee who had quietly watched the rehearsals recalled that at the Boston performances Hammerstein would have a secretary mark on the script any sound of the chairs squeaking as indicating that the audience was restless Hammerstein rewrote some of the book to expand the focus from Ta himself to the romantic relationships of the two couples br br br Productions br br br Original Broadway production br br After the Boston tryouts Flower Drum Song opened on Broadway at the St James Theatre on December Sets were designed by Oliver Smith costumes by Irene Sharaff and lighting by Peggy Clark br C Y Lee sat in the audience on the first night he later stated that he had been nervous and was bowled over by the positive audience reaction The show attracted considerable advance sales even when these were exhausted sales remained strong and sellouts were the norm Cast album sales were similar to previous Rodgers and Hammerstein hits The show received six Tony Award nominations but won only one Tony Best Conductor and Musical Director for Salvatore Dell Isola It was overshadowed that year by Redhead which though it received only slightly better reviews than Flower Drum Song and had a considerably shorter run dominated the Tony Awards in the musical categories Flower Drum Song ran for performances a longer run than any of the shows with which it had competed for Asian performers br Midway through the run Larry Blyden left the show and was replaced in the role of Sammy Fong by Jack Soo with Larry Leung assuming the role of Frankie Wing The production returned profit to its backers on an investment of Attendance began to decline in December though it continued to draw at above the of capacity level which a Broadway play then needed to meet expenses With the summer approaching generally a bad time for attendance it was decided to close the show and the last Broadway performance was given on May br In his autobiography Rodgers wrote of the effect the success of Flower Drum Song had on his state of mind br br The entire experience of working on Flower Drum Song was rewarding in many ways not the least of which was that it convinced me that I had overcome all traces of my depression My only thought was to keep on doing what I was doing and I saw nothing in the future that could stop me br br br Subsequent productions br The show opened in London s Palace Theatre on March and ran for performances Fewer Asian performers were used in London the West End production starred Yau Shan Tung as Mei Li Kevin Scott as Ta George Minami as Wang Harriet Yamasaki Yama Saki as Linda Low Tim Herbert as Sammy Fong and Ida Shepley as Madam Liang The production used Haney s choreography Bennett s orchestrations and the Broadway set and costume designs but was directed and supervised by Jerome Whyte Both the production and the London cast album were well received br Following the closure of the Broadway production a U S national tour began on May in Detroit Four of the New York leads Hall Soo Kenney and Luke joined the tour By this time Hammerstein was in his final illness he died in August and none of the three producers accompanied the show on the road After three weeks in Detroit the show moved to Los Angeles where the premiere attracted a star studded audience including three Scandinavian princesses San Francisco gave the show a rapturous reception when it opened at the Curran Theatre on August Lee and Fields both present for the local premiere were given ovations Geary Street on which the theatre is located was decorated with Chinese lanterns and a marching band of Chinese girl musicians played outside The tour continued to be successful spending weeks in Chicago alone It closed on October in Cleveland a month before the film of the musical opened br Lewis calls the film version of Flower Drum Song starring Umeki Soo Hall and Suzie Wong star Nancy Kwan a bizarre pastiche of limping mediocrity He comments that since the version of the musical was rarely revived the film would in future years come to stand for the stage musical it so crassly misrepresented and would serve as the version that academics and latter day theatre critics would judge when they analyzed the musical The film was the only Hollywood adaptation of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical to lose money Nevertheless it was nominated for five Academy Awards and featured choreography by Hermes Pan As early as mid the musical was licensed for local productions That summer the San Diego Civic Light Opera filled the seat Balboa Park Bowl to overflowing for a highly successful run of the musical It was less successfully revived by that company five years later though it still attracted large crowds local critics complained that Hammerstein s view of Asians was outdated Other early productions included successful revivals by the St Louis Municipal Opera in and and revivals in the San Francisco area in and both times with Soo as Sammy Fong br The musical proved difficult to produce for amateur and school groups however because it requires a cast either Asian or made up as Asian Even professional companies found it difficult to round up an entire cast of Asian singer dancer actors By the late s the musical was rarely staged and was often relegated to dinner theater productions The Rodgers Hammerstein Organization which licenses the partnership s works believes that the work s loss of popularity was due in part to increased racial sensitivity in the U S after the civil rights movement In addition producers found the show to be thinly plotted and the songs not integrated as organically with the characters and story as compared with Rodgers and Hammerstein s most popular musicals br Flower Drum Song came to be seen by some as stereotypical and patronizing towards Asians and that it was inauthentic even offensive in its relentlessly upbeat picture of a big city Chinatown In the announcement that it would be produced in San Francisco started a furor the producers pointedly stated that the show would be set in the s and would have a greater sensitivity toward the Chinese immigration problems at that time They added a scene in which Mei Li listens apprehensively to a radio broadcast warning about the dangers to the United States caused by Asian immigration Many lines of dialogue were cut and producer Fred Van Patten stated that w hat we ve done is cut things in the show that Asians said to make white people laugh The song Chop Suey was deleted as was Master Wang s line that all white men look alike based on a line in C Y Lee s novel in which Wang states that all foreigners look alike The author gave a rare public interview to defend his novel and the musical adaptation The production which had been scheduled for a three week run closed early A well attended production in Oakland in adhered strictly to the script though part of the ballet was cut for lack of rehearsal time a more heavily censored production in San Mateo also did well at the box office br br br revival br In while attending the successful revival of The King and I Chinese American playwright David Henry Hwang considered whether other Rodgers and Hammerstein shows could be revived and decided to work on Flower Drum Song To Chinese Americans the musical represented political incorrectness incarnate But Hwang had a secret soft spot for the movie version It was kind of a guilty pleasure and one of the only big Hollywood films where you could see a lot of really good Asian actors onscreen singing and dancing and cracking jokes Ted Chapin president of the Rodgers Hammerstein Organization announced that an unnamed Asian playwright had approached him about revising Flower Drum Song Chapin called the musical a naive old fashioned anti feminist story with a truly great score It s one that needs changes Rodgers will urged his heirs to do what they believed he would have agreed to Hammerstein s instructions are unknown but during her lifetime his widow Dorothy had refused to countenance major changes in the plays Hwang s involvement was soon revealed and in C Y Lee announced that the rewrite had his approval br Hwang was given a free hand with dialogue he was not allowed to change lyrics Hwang was inexperienced at writing musicals and the producers hired veteran Robert Longbottom to direct the production and collaborate on the new script really a new musical which has a pre existing score Only the character names the San Francisco Chinatown setting and some of the relationships were retained but the pair sought to be faithful to the spirit of both Lee s novel and the musical s original concept of old world and older generation values struggling with new world temptations and the desires of the younger generation This concept is reflected in the struggle for survival of Wang s Chinese opera company as it competes with the more modern Americanized night club run by Ta The role of Mei li as spelled in the revision was expanded The character of Madam Liang was changed from the wise owl aunt to a savvy career woman in show business Chinatown is portrayed as a more gritty and difficult place for new immigrants and the pursuit of material success is given a more cynical face especially in Act II The song The Other Generation was deleted My Best Love which had been cut in tryouts in was restored in its place and The Next Time It Happens was imported from Pipe Dream New orchestrations were by Don Sebesky and music director David Chase According to The New York Times Hwang has reshaped the story to elucidate two of his own abiding thematic interests the idea of the theater as a prism for society and the generational clashes of diversely assimilated immigrants br In September after development through a series of workshops the new version was presented at two well attended workshops for potential backers The show failed to raise enough money for an immediate Broadway run but Hwang hoped that an extended Los Angeles run would lead to raising additional funds The revival was originally planned for the seat Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles but to save money he moved it to the nearby seat Mark Taper Forum Producer Gordon Davidson engaged an all Asian cast including Broadway star Lea Salonga as Mei li When it finally opened on October the production received rave reviews from the Los Angeles critics The show regularly sold out and was so popular it became the first show at the Taper to extend its scheduled run It finally closed on January br br The success of the Los Angeles run sparked sufficient investment to move the show to Broadway Half the cast was dismissed after the Los Angeles run for unstated reasons Mary Rodgers later commented that Randall Duk Kim replaced Tzi Ma as Wang because she had admired Kim s performance as the Kralahome in the revival of The King and I but Kim was unavailable for the Los Angeles run Hwang considerably altered and trimmed his long script during Broadway rehearsals and previews The Next Time It Happens was removed from the show During the runup to the Broadway opening the show received mostly positive publicity br Opening night at the Virginia Theatre on October was attended by veterans of the film and production Though it received warm applause from the audience the critics mostly panned it Attendance was near capacity during the first month of the run but then dropped off precipitously The producers hoped the show could hold out long enough to get a boost from the Tony Awards though nominated for three including best book it won none but in February they announced that the show would close on March after performances The show s backers lost their entire investment br The production was directed and choreographed by Longbottom with scenic design by Robin Wagner costume design by Gregg Barnes and lighting design by Natasha Katz Critic Karen Wada in her afterword to the published script blamed the sluggish economy post September jitters the New York Times mixed review and unusually bitter winter weather for the unexpectedly short run Lee also felt that the influential Times review had hurt the show s acceptance but commented that Hwang added some dialogue to Act II after the Los Angeles run that Lee felt slowed the show down The closing was followed by a national tour that garnered mixed reviews although Hwang stated that it was well received in every city except New York br Subsequent productions have favored the Hwang script although the older version remains available for license and has received occasional revivals including a staged concert as part of Ian Marshall Fisher s Lost Musicals series A review in London s The Times compared this production with the much grander production of Show Boat currently docked at the Albert Hall and judged that Flower Drum Song makes the more stimulating experience br br br plot br Prologue br In Wu Mei li a performer in Chinese opera flees China with a flower drum after her father dies in prison for defying the Communists A Hundred Million Miracles br Act I br On arrival in the United States Mei li goes to the Golden Pearl Theatre in San Francisco s Chinatown where little attended Chinese opera is presented by her father s old friend Wang Chi yang and Wang s foster brother Chin One night a week Wang s son Ta turns the theater into a nightclub starring the very assimilated Linda Low a Chinese American stripper from Seattle Linda s constant companion is a gay costume designer Harvard so named by his success obsessed Chinese parents The nightclub is profitable the Chinese opera is not Mei li joins the opera company I Am Going to Like It Here and is soon attracted to the indifferent Ta who favors Linda Mei li is fascinated by Linda who urges her to adopt the American lifestyle I Enjoy Being a Girl Linda is soon signed by talent agent Rita Liang who pushes Wang to turn the theater into a club full time Grant Avenue and he reluctantly opens Club Chop Suey br Ta slowly is becoming attracted to Mei li who now serves as a waitress but he has competition from fortune cookie factory worker Chao whom Mei li met on the slow journey from China and who is rapidly becoming discontented with America Wang is also unhappy despite the club s success and it is no consolation the crowd is having a good time after all in the old country no crowd ever came to his theater expecting to enjoy themselves Outraged at Harvard s poor acting skills Wang takes the stage in his place his stage instincts take over Gliding Through My Memories and he is soon an enthusiastic supporter of the change taking the stage name Sammy Fong Linda advises Mei li to put on one of her old stripper dresses to attract Ta but the stratagem backfires since Ta is attracted to Mei li because of her wholesomeness Ta and Mei li quarrel she takes her flower drum and leaves Club Chop Suey br Act II br Several months pass and Club Chop Suey has become even flashier Chop Suey Ta can not forget Mei li and his uncle Chin a janitor under the new regime advises Ta to pursue her My Best Love He finds her in a fortune cookie factory working alongside Chao Mei li tells Ta that she and Chao have decided to return to China together or at least to Hong Kong then administered by the British Meanwhile Wang now finds himself attracted to Madam Liang and the two have dinner together though they decide not to marry Don t Marry Me They marry anyway br Linda announces that she is leaving for Los Angeles as Wang s Sammy Fong act has effectively taken over the show and she has received a better offer Ta intercepts Mei li at the docks and persuades her to remain in America Ta leaves Club Chop Suey and the two become street performers as Chao departs for Hong Kong Harvard announces his intention to return home and attempt a reconciliation with his disappointed parents Despite his irritation at Ta Wang allows him to marry Mei li at the club which now features Ta s Chinese opera one day a week as the company celebrates how Chinese and American cultures have converged to create this happy moment Finale A Hundred Million Miracles br br br Critical reception br br br Original productions br Of the seven major New York newspaper drama reviewers five gave the show very positive reviews For example New York Journal American critic John McClain stated Flower Drum Song is a big fat Rodgers and Hammerstein hit and nothing written here will have the slightest effect on the proceeds The New York Daily Mirror termed it Another notable work by the outstanding craftsmen of our musical theatre a lovely show an outstanding one in theme and treatment Less enthusiastic however was the longtime New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson who repeatedly described it as merely pleasant UPI s drama critic Jack Gaver scored it as well north of Me and Juliet and Pipe Dream but well south of Oklahoma Carousel South Pacific and even the team s first flop Allegro Ward Morehouse applauded Suzuki for having a brassy voice and the assurance of a younger Ethel Merman and termed the production an excellent Broadway show though p erhaps it doesn t belong in the same world as The King and I and Carousel Critic Kenneth Tynan in The New Yorker magazine alluded to the show The World of Suzie Wong in dismissing Flower Drum Song with the spoonerism a world of woozy song br When the national tour of the show visited the city of its setting most San Francisco reviewers gave the show very positive reviews though the Oakland Tribune critic described the musical as one which has little by way of witty dialogue outstanding songs or vigorous choreography Nevertheless she called the touring production superior to the Broadway one br br br revival br Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times called the show wholly revised and gleefully self aware a few tons short of a mega musical no fake helicopters here no power ballads saccharine enough to stop Communism in its tracks The Hollywood Reporter thought the revival was while not perfect an exhilarating accomplishment Variety called it a bold theatrical operation an artistic success br Critics reviewing the New York production generally gave it poor reviews Ben Brantley of The New York Times applauded the creative team s honorable intentions in bringing back a work thought to be terminally out of date but felt both the new Mei li and the show in general lacked personality Howard Kissel of the New York Daily News termed it an entertaining albeit vulgar revival and Clive Barnes of the New York Post found it no more memorable than the earlier version The review in Talkin Broadway is scathing criticizing Hwang s use of the songs and characters and the orchestrations and commenting Hwang s book lacks much of the charm warmth and wit of the original and never takes the high road where the low road will do Hwang felt it necessary to reduce the original uniquely colorful story into just another backstager with a love triangle and lame jokes Michael Kuchwara commented in his lukewarm review for Associated Press Then there s Linda Low s gay confidante Harvard Talk about stereotypes If you are going to perpetuate one at least give him better jokes On the other hand both USA Today and Time magazine gave it positive reviews The CurtainUp review was mostly positive and observed that Hwang and Longbottom were able to keep numbers like Chop Suey and milk it for its razzle dazzle fun while using its condescending stereotyping as a springboard to satirize attitudes towards Asians Brantley disagreed writing because the show s satiric point of view is so muddled there s no verve in such numbers no joy in the performing of them br In David Lewis compared the original script to Hwang s version br br History never completely goes away Hwang s champions are unlikely to fade away either in rhetorical defeat Dick and Oscar and Joe mined C Y Lee s novel for the generational conflict and for the three women who substantiated Ta s honorable search for love Those themes like it or not still resonate today br br br Music and recordings br br Rodgers and Hammerstein sought to give the new work an Eastern flavor without using existing oriental music According to Ben Brantley in his review of the Broadway revival the use by Rodgers of repetitive Eastern musical structures gives the numbers a sing song catchiness that for better or worse exerts a sticky hold on the memory The most oriental sounding song in the work is A Hundred Million Miracles which provides the eight note drumbeat which is the musical signature of the work from overture to curtain Hammerstein wrote Mei Li s first act song I Am Going to Like It Here in a Malaysian poetic form called pantoum in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza become the first and third lines of the next One critic thought that the version s orchestrations boast more Asian accents and a jazzier edge than the original but another felt that they pale in comparison to Bennett s typically lilting sound br As with many of Rodgers and Hammerstein s musicals the work features a ballet at the start of the second act choreographed in the original production by Carol Haney The ballet dramatizes the confused romantic longings of Wang Ta towards the women in his life and ends as he awakens in Helen Chao s bed Thomas Hischak in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia notes that the ballets in Oklahoma and Carousel choreographed by Agnes de Mille broke new ground in illustrating facets of the characters beyond what is learned in songs and dialogue but describes the ballet in Flower Drum Song as pleasant but not memorable Although Hischak describes Rodgers as the greatest waltz composer America has ever seen Flower Drum Song was the first Rodgers and Hammerstein musical not to feature one br br Several of the characters are given I am songs that introduce them to the audience allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character Linda Low for example expresses her self confidence with I Enjoy Being a Girl we learn Mei Li s hopes with the quieter I Am Going to Like It Here Although not a formal musical number the brief You Be the Rock I ll Be the Roll sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San Ta s Americanized teenage brother was described by Lewis as virtually the first self consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung in a Broadway musical Patrick Adiarte who originated the role of Wang San however saw it as corny stuff put in there to get a laugh Helen Chao s sad Love Look Away is described by Lewis as arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote br Having decided that record companies were profiting more from the sales of their cast albums than they were Rodgers and Hammerstein formed their own record company to produce the cast recording for the original production of Flower Drum Song The album sold a relatively modest copies compared with sales of over a million copies for Rodgers and Hammerstein s next and final musical The Sound of Music Still it was certified as a gold record for having at least a million dollars in sales and it spent weeks in the U S Top three of them at number and also did well in the UK when the show opened there in The original cast album is relatively complete even including parts of the Wedding Parade though it does not include the ballet br In the London cast recording was released According to Hischak the individual performers do not sing as well as the New York cast the London recording s strong points are the nightclub numbers The album from the film uses a larger orchestra and according to Hischak has a fuller sound than the Broadway recording It features dubbing by the opera singer Marilyn Horne Love Look Away and band singer B J Baker for Linda Low s songs A cast album for Hwang s revision was released in featuring strong performances from Lea Salonga as Mei li and Jose Llana as Wang Ta This was nominated for a Grammy
