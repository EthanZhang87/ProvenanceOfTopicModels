over the club s tenancy of the ground The annual rent had risen from in to in Houlding wanted to sell the ground to the club which in turn wished to agree a long term rental Houlding would only agree to this on the basis of a rent at a level unacceptable to the club Negotiations having failed the directors decided to leave Anfield and find another ground leaving Houlding with an empty stadium His response was to form a new football club to occupy the stadium He attempted to retain the team name Everton by registering the name Everton Football Club and Athletic Grounds Company Limited with Companies House but the Football League decided that the name belonged to the departed Everton club which acquired new premises at Goodison Park Houlding therefore adopted the name Liverpool Football Club for his new venture br Having established his new club Houlding applied for membership of the First Division of the Football League rather than the newly formed Second Division The League unimpressed with this premature application refused to admit the club which instead joined the Lancashire League Liverpool played their first match on September a pre season friendly match against Rotherham Town which they won The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as

Blackpool They also won the Liverpool District Cup by defeating Everton The subsequent theft of the league and cup trophies cost the club to replace them Following their success Liverpool reapplied to

and was often the focal point of the team as an important defensive player and the instigator of many of Liverpool s attacks Raybould was signed from local club New Brighton Tower and in the season scored seven times as the club won nine of their last eleven matches to finish in tenth place He would go on to score goals in matches for Liverpool Success in the season looked unlikely in February at which point Liverpool had lost eight games and conceded goals However they won nine and drew three of their next twelve matches while only conceding four goals to achieve their first League title They were less successful in the following two seasons finishing in eleventh and fifth places respectively The season saw the club relegated to the Second Division like the previous relegation it was only for one year as they won the division the following season On their return in the season they became the first team to win the Second and First Division in successive seasons They also reached

games put their chances in doubt A victory over West Bromwich Albion in the last match of the season was enough to secure Liverpool s third League championship br Ashworth left Liverpool midway through the following season to manage Oldham Athletic he wished to be closer to his wife and daughter who lived in nearby Stockport His replacement was the former Liverpool player Matt McQueen a club director McQueen was intended as a temporary appointment but he kept the job as Liverpool retained the League championship This success owed much to the form of their goalkeeper Elisha Scott who conceded only goals during the season a league record at the time Liverpool s total of points in the season equalled the record set by West Bromwich Albion three seasons earlier Harry Chambers top scored in the first four post World War seasons including the two title wins br Following their successive championships Liverpool s fortunes declined as their side aged Some of the players had begun their careers before the war goalkeeper Scott had been in the side since The club began the season aiming to win three league titles in a row but finished in twelfth place They achieved fourth place the following season which was to be their best finish until after the Second World War Changes to the offside rule in the season resulted in an increase in the number of goals scored during matches Liverpool contributed to this with big victories over Manchester United and Newcastle United but could only manage a seventh place finish br In the Kop had been redesigned and extended to hold spectators all standing At the time the Kop was the biggest football stand in the country able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds The increase in spectators did not fully

continued to deteriorate and they avoided relegation in the season by only four points Scott left the club at the end of what had been a poor season for the veteran goalkeeper In ten matches from the start of Liverpool won only once with Scott in goal and after a defeat against Newcastle United he was replaced by Arthur Riley The change of goalkeepers brought an upturn in form with a victory over Birmingham City and a win against Middlesbrough Scott who joined Belfast Celtic after years at Liverpool remains the club s longest serving player As they became used to finishing in the lower part of the league table Liverpool began to lose their best players Hodgson who had scored goals in league games was sold to Aston Villa in and the club struggled to replace him They finished th in the season following his departure Also in Patterson resigned as manager for health reasons and resumed his role as the club s secretary His replacement Southampton manager George Kay did not initially fare much better Liverpool narrowly avoided relegation in the season and finished in th place in each of the following two seasons By the outbreak of the Second World War Liverpool had become accustomed to finishing midtable br Soon after the outbreak of war in the season was cancelled and all first class football in Britain temporarily suspended When matches resumed competitions were played on a regional basis as in the previous war and teams often did not complete a full season Liverpool participated in the Football League North which they won in the season Many footballers served in the

hat tricks in three successive matches br The club were unable to match this success in the two seasons that followed and finished in th and th places respectively The season brought another disappointing league campaign The season started well as the club was unbeaten in their first matches and was top of the league at the turn of the year Their form declined thereafter and they finished eighth This did not hinder their progress in the FA Cup as they reached their second final their first at Wembley against Arsenal They were unable to win their first FA Cup two goals from Arsenal

not enough for Welsh to keep his job and he was sacked at the end of the season His replacement was Phil Taylor a former captain of the club and a member of the coaching staff Taylor signed players such as Ronnie Moran Alan A Court and Jimmy Melia who would become mainstays of the club for seasons to come but was unable to guide Liverpool back to the First Division The Liverpool board persisted
