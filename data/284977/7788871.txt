The British football betting scandal occurred when a Football League First Division match between Manchester United and Liverpool at Old Trafford on April Good Friday was fixed in United s favour with players from both sides benefiting from bets placed upon the result In all seven players were found to have participated in the scandal and all were subsequently banned for life although most later had their bans overturned br br br The match br At the time of the match Manchester United were struggling to avoid relegation while Liverpool were in mid table and neither challenging for honours nor facing the threat of relegation themselves The effects of the First World War provided further motivation to perpetrate a fix by the end of March it was almost certain that the league would suspend operations after the season was finished interrupting and possibly ending the footballing careers of everyone then playing in the league Also the players perhaps thought that the diversion of the conflict would lessen the attention that would normally be paid to a dubious match result br The match ended in a win to United with George Anderson scoring both goals However the match referee and some observers noted Liverpool s lack of commitment during the game they had missed a penalty that had been awarded to them and when Fred Pagnam hit the Manchester United crossbar late in the match his teammates publicly remonstrated with him br br br Investigation and punishments br After the match handbills started to appear alleging that a large amount of money had been bet at odds of on a win to United The Football Association launched an investigation and found that players from both sides had been involved in rigging the match Sandy Turnbull Arthur Whalley and Enoch West of United and Jackie Sheldon Tom Miller Bob Pursell and Thomas Fairfoul of Liverpool Sheldon was a former United player himself and was found to be the plot s ringleader Some players such as Pagnam and United s George Anderson had refused to take part Pagnam had threatened to score a goal to ruin the result hence his late shot against the crossbar he later testified against his team mates at the FA hearing At the same hearing United player Billy Meredith denied any knowledge of the match fixing but stated that he became suspicious when none of his teammates would pass the ball to him br All seven players were banned from playing for life in a decision handed down on December The FA concluded that it had been a conspiracy by the players alone no official from either club was found guilty of wrongdoing and neither club was fined or had points deducted West vociferously protested his innocence even going so far as suing the FA for libel However he lost the case and the ban stood In itself the ban had no immediate effect on the players footballing careers as by that point the Football League had suspended operations for the duration of the First World War The ban did not apply in Scotland four of the suspended players were Scottish however the Scottish Football Association was never called upon to issue any sort of ruling on the players eligibility there br Sandy Turnbull was killed while serving in the war but all the other players except West had their bans lifted by the FA in in recognition of their service to the country Turnbull received a posthumous reinstatement The intervention of the First World War meant that the Football League did not resume until This meant that West was the only player involved who was actually unable to play League football due to suspension Fairfoul also did not return to football although he was re instated however the other four players resumed their careers after the war West had to wait until for his ban to be lifted by which time he was br br br Consequences br Although the players main motives for the match fixing appear to be financial and not to save United from relegation the two points United won from that game were enough to earn them th place and safety one point ahead of th placed Chelsea who were nominally relegated Before the season started the League decided to expand the First Division by two teams Chelsea along with Arsenal were elected back into the First Division and thus spared the drop br br br See also br British betting scandal a similar betting scandal nearly years later br Turkish sports corruption scandal br br br br Pre War United RedCafe net Archived from the original on May Retrieved November br Red Devilry rednews co uk Archived from the original on March br Airey Tom Burnell Paul April Man Utd v Liverpool The Good Friday betting scandal BBC News br br br Further reading br br Inglis Simon Soccer in the Dock A History of British Football Scandals to Eclecta Books ISBN br Sharpe Graham Free the Manchester United One The Inside Story of Football s Greatest Scam Robson Books ISBN
