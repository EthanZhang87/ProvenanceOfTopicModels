Kuwait br br br Bidding process br br The bidding process for the Summer Olympics was officially launched on May The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by September confirming their intention to bid Completed official bid files containing answers to a question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of January On June two months before the Beijing Olympics four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist Chicago Madrid Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in Three cities Baku Doha and Prague failed to reach the candidature phase Doha was not promoted despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro because of their proposal to host the Olympics

infrastructures including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time br Nawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the member Evaluation Commission having also chaired the evaluation commission for the Summer Olympics bids which was awarded to London United Kingdom The commission made on site inspections in the second quarter of They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on September one month before the elections br Many safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the IOC members eligible to vote in the elections For example cities could not invite any IOC member to visit nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift Nonetheless bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media br br Ultimately you are communicating with just people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about people perhaps in the broadest sense It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign br The final voting was held in Copenhagen on October with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting and Tokyo after the second The latter city would eventually be awarded the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid heading into the final round the lead was held and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the Summer Olympics br br br Development and preparation br On June it was reported on AroundTheRings com that Roderlei Generali the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC This came just five months after CCO Fl vio Pestana quit for personal reasons Pestana withdrew later during the Summer Paralympics and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO br br br Venues and infrastructure br br Events took place at eighteen existing venues nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games and seven temporary venues br For the events held in Rio de Janeiro each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters Barra Copacabana Deodoro and Maracan as was done for the Pan American Games Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than minutes and almost per cent could do so in less than minutes Of the competition venues eight underwent some permanent works seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent

historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as Porto Maravilha covering km sq mi in area The project aimed to redevelop the port area increase the city center s attractiveness and enhance Rio s competitive position in the global economy br The urban renovation involved km mi of public networks for water supply sanitation drainage electricity gas and telecom km mi of tunnels km mi of roads km sq mi of sidewalks km mi of bike path trees and three sanitation treatment plants As part of this renovation a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodovi ria Novo Rio due to open in April br The Games required over kilometers of security fencing A square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village The second warehouse of square meters in Duque de Caxias near the roads that provide access to the venues contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events br br br Medals br br The medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil the Brazilian mint The medal design was unveiled on June They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials the bronze and silver medals contained recycled materials The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria such as being extracted without the use of mercury The medals feature a wreath design on the front and in keeping with tradition the obverse features Nike the Greek goddess of victory A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games emblem br In May an Associated Press article disclosed that over athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage including black spots flaking or surface degrading Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with to percent of all those awarded br br br Torch relay br br The Olympic flame was lit on April at the Temple of Hera in Olympia the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on April A brief stop off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva br The torch relay began its journey around Brazil on May at the capital Bras lia The flame visited more than Brazilian cities including all state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony br br br Volunteers br Unpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games A target of volunteers was set as early as More than applications were received when recruitment took place in The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets beige trousers white socks and green trainers which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials athletes family members and media allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals br br br Ticketing br The ticket prices were announced on September all of which were sold in Brazilian reais BRL A total of million tickets were to be sold in total with ticket prices ranging from BRL for many events to BRL for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony About million of these tickets were available for BRL or less br br br Sustainability br br As an aspect of its bid Rio s organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the Games going on to dub them a Green Games for a Blue Planet As legacy projects organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities upgrade Rio s sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay and plant million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games However some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them br The focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols To reduce emissions the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames The bronze and silver medals as well as the ribbons on all medals were designed to incorporate recycled materials The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies as had been the tradition at previous Olympics although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate if kept The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture br The Future Arena the venue for the handball competitions was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools However as of November the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the budget Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change br br br The Games br br br Opening ceremony br br The opening ceremony took place at Maracan Stadium on August directed by Fernando Meirelles Daniela Thomas and Andrucha Waddington The ceremony highlighted

by the IOC on those that have made significant achievements in education culture development and peace through sport the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil Michel Temer br The Olympic cauldron was lit by long distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima the men s marathon bronze medalist at the Olympics who had also received the IOC s Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pel but he declined to participate due to health problems br Following the opening ceremony a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candel ria Church by Jorge Gomes a year old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner br br br Sports br br The Summer Olympic program featured sports encompassing events The number of events in each of discipline is noted in parentheses br br br New sports br br In April the IOC began accepting applications for two new sports to be introduced to the Olympic programme Baseball and softball which were both dropped in karate squash golf roller sports and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June br In August the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens a seven player version of rugby union by a majority vote baseball softball roller sports and squash were removed from contention leaving golf karate and rugby sevens in the running A final vote was held on October the closing day of the st IOC Session At this session a new voting system was in place a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two thirds majority previously required br The st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio Olympic programme The tally for rugby was in favor with eight against and golf was approved by votes to Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics rugby last featured in and golf in br In May the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the Olympics but this decision was reversed in November br br br Participating National Olympic Committees br br All National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany Great Britain and the Netherlands who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the FEI World Equestrian Games br As host nation Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events br The Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti doping violations br Kuwait was banned in October for the second time in five years over government interference in the country s Olympic committee Kuwaiti athletes instead participated as Independent Olympic Athletes br br br Number of athletes by National Olympic Committee br athletes from NOCs br br br Refugee athletes br br Due to the European migrant crisis and other reasons the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag During the previous Summer Olympic Games refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs On March the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team ROT out of refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible were chosen to form the team br br br Independent athletes br br Due to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes br In November Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations IAAF following a World Anti Doping Agency WADA report into a doping program in the country The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for exceptional eligibility to participate in the Games as neutral athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program br On July the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA s recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally stating that the Olympic Charter does not foresee such neutral athletes and that it was each country s National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing As a result Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag although they would compete under a neutral flag in the Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation br br br National houses br During the Games some countries and continents had a national house These temporary meeting places for supporters athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro

records and ninety one Olympic records were set during the Summer Olympics The records were set in archery athletics canoeing cycling track modern pentathlon rowing shooting swimming and weightlifting br br br Event scheduling br br A number of events most notably in aquatics beach volleyball and track and field were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as p m to midnight BRT These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U S television ratings when possible on May NBC agreed to a US billion contract extension to air the Olympics through including US billion for Rio as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo As Bras lia time is only one hour ahead of the U S Eastern Time Zone certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U S primetime hours traditionally to p m ET p m to midnight BRT allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed This practice was also beneficial to Globo a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas as they are among the highest rated programs in the country br br br Closing ceremony br br The closing ceremony of the Summer Olympics was held on August from to BRT at the Maracan Stadium As per traditional Olympic protocol the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current Brazil and following Japan host countries as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach who declared the Games closed and the Games organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike whose city will host the Summer Olympics and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame br The creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalh

segment introducing the athletes singer Roberta S channeled Carmen Miranda the fruit headdress wearing mid century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of children representing the states of Brazil sang the Brazilian national anthem br br br Cost br br The Oxford Olympics Study estimated the out turn cost of the Rio Summer Olympics at US billion in dollars This figure included sports related costs that is i operational costs incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games of which the largest components were technology transportation workforce and administration costs while other operational costs included security catering ceremonies and medical services and ii direct capital costs incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues the Olympic village international broadcast center and media and press center which were required to host the Games br Indirect capital costs were not included such as for road rail or airport infrastructure for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games The Rio Olympics cost of US billion compares with costs of US billion for Beijing and US billion for Sochi the two most expensive Olympics in history The average cost of the Summer Games since is US billion br br br Medal table br br The top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below Host nation Brazil finished in th place with a total of medals gold silver and bronze br br Host nation Brazil br br br Podium sweeps br br br Broadcasting br br Olympic Broadcasting Services served as the host broadcaster for the Games Produced from a total of seven mobile units OBS distributed hours of television footage and hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders For the first time in Olympic history digital oriented footage exceeded the amount of television oriented footage The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games including the opening ceremony and selected events in K resolution video Additionally expanding upon a degree trial at the Winter Youth Olympics hours of video content were originated in degree virtual reality formats In the United States NBC offered K content downconverted from the K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support to participating television providers Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS br In August the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo Replacing Record the deal covers free to air coverage on Rede Globo pay TV and digital rights to the Games In turn Globo sublicensed partial free to air rights to Rede Record along with Rede Bandeirantes IOC board member Richard Carri n described the agreement as unprecedented touting that by working with Brazil s leading media organizations we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast both during and outside Games time and Brazilians will have more choice of how when and where they follow their Olympic Games br br br Olympic Golden Rings Awards br br In November the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by

finishing third The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC with ZDF and SporTV Globosat picking up the second and third places The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV Globosat while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium br br br Marketing br br br Mascots br br On November the official mascots of the Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled created by Sao Paulo based animation company Birdo The Olympic mascot Vinicius named after musician Vinicius de Moraes represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats monkeys and birds According to their fictional backgrounds the mascots were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games br Brand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil s culture and people The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on December The names which reference the co writers of the song The Girl from Ipanema won over two other sets of names tallying percent of votes At the Olympic wrestling events coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee s call br br br Emblem br br The official emblem for the Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tat l Design and was unveiled on December winning in a competition against agencies The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain It was also designed to have a three dimensional form which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first D logo in the history of the Olympics br The logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse s painting Dance There were also allegations by the Colorado based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own while also consisting of several figures linked in motion the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event in the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador Gelli defended the allegations stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original as it was an ancient reference and in the collective unconscious Gelli cited Dance as an influence of the logo s concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible br br br Concerns and controversies br br The lead up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies including Brazil s political and economic crisis the Zika virus epidemic the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games However the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident br br br Political and economic crisis br br In Operation Car Wash an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state controlled oil company Petrobras In early a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair By early the scandal had escalated into a full blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff but also former President Luiz In cio Lula da Silva resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters both anti and pro Rousseff At the same time Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the s raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop On May President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games br On October Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money laundering investigation into a million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment which was three days before the vote in All three were charged with money laundering along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares and ex Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner All six were charged with running a criminal organization money laundering and violating currency laws in their own native countries On July it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games br br br Zika virus br br An outbreak of the mosquito borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games br In May a group of physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization WHO calling upon them to according to co author Arthur Caplan have an open transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil The WHO dismissed the request stating that cancelling or changing the location of the Olympics would not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus and that there was no public health justification for postponing them br Some athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic On September however the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the Olympics br br br Environmental problems br br The Guanabara Bay whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions is heavily polluted Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long term issue At the Earth Summit in officials promised they would begin to address the pollution but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient As an aspect of their bid for the Games Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay However some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues Prior to these efforts only of Rio s sewage was treated this raw sewage also leaked into the bay Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having of sewage treated at least of sewage was treated by March with a projected goal of of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics br br br Security br br Rio s crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the Games mayor Paes stated that the city was facing big issues in heightening security but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process br The governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the Summer Olympics The estimate was that men of the National Public Security Force and military officers Army Navy and of the Brazilian Air Force in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January would act during the Olympic Games br On July two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist cell named Ansar al Khilafah Brazil by arresting people br br br Russian doping scandal br br In December media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state sponsored doping in Russia comparing it to doping in East Germany In November the World Anti Doping Agency WADA published a report and the International Association of Athletics Federations IAAF suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events The United Kingdom Anti Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia In June they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service FSB agents After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the Winter Olympics in Sochi WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren which found corroborating evidence concluding in a report published in July that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a state directed failsafe system using a disappearing positive test methodology DPM from at least late to August br In response to these findings WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non compliant with respect to the World Anti Doping Code and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the Summer Olympics The IOC rejected the recommendation stating that the IOC and each sport s international federation would make decisions on each athlete s individual basis A day before the opening ceremony athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag while were removed because of doping In contrast the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non doping related matter Unlike the IOC the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the Summer Paralympics and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the Winter Paralympics br br br See also br br Summer Paralympics br
