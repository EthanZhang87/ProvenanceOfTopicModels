Desert Island Discs is a radio programme broadcast on BBC Radio It was first broadcast on the BBC Forces Programme on January br Each week a guest called a castaway during the programme is asked to choose eight audio recordings usually but not always music a book and a luxury item that they would take if they were to be cast away on a desert island whilst discussing their life and the reasons for their choices It was devised and originally presented by Roy Plomley Since the programme has been presented by Lauren Laverne br More than episodes have been recorded with some guests having appeared more than once and some episodes featuring more than one guest An example of a guest who falls into both categories is Bob Monkhouse who appeared with his co writer Denis Goodwin on December and in his own right on December br When Desert Island Discs marked its th year in The Guardian called the show a radio classic In February a panel of broadcasting industry experts named it the greatest radio programme of all time br br br Format br Guests are invited to imagine themselves cast away on a desert island and choose eight audio recordings originally gramophone records to take with them discussion of their choices permits a review of their life Excerpts from their choices are played or in the case of short pieces the whole work At the end of the programme they choose the one piece they regard most highly Guests are also automatically given the Complete Works of Shakespeare and either the Bible or another appropriate religious or philosophical work They are then prompted to select a third book to accompany them Popular choices include Charles Dickens and Jane Austen Actress Judi Dench who has macular degeneration was permitted to take an audiobook in place of a printed manuscript br Guests also choose one luxury which must be inanimate and of no use in escaping the island or allowing communication from outside Roy Plomley enforced these rules strictly He did however grant a special dispensation to Princess Michael of Kent who chose her pet cat However subsequent presenters have allowed more variation on the rules John Cleese was allowed to take Michael Palin with him on the condition that he was dead and stuffed Examples of luxuries have included champagne and a piano the latter of which is one of the most requested luxuries br After Plomley s death in the programme was presented by Michael Parkinson from to then from to by Sue Lawley and from to by Kirsty Young Young was replaced by Music presenter Lauren Laverne who interviewed Olympic diver Tom Daley for her first show broadcast on September Laverne was initially drafted in as an interim presenter while Young was suffering from fibromyalgia she was appointed permanently in July when Young announced her decision not to return br br br Notable guests br br The first castaway was Vic Oliver and several castaways including Celia Johnson Arthur Askey Trevor Nunn John Schlesinger Kenneth Williams Terry Wogan Brian Rix David Attenborough John Mortimer Adele Leigh Delia Smith and Stephen Fry have been cast away more than once The most requested piece of music over the first years was Ode to Joy the last movement of Beethoven s Ninth Symphony One of the most remarked broadcasts was Elisabeth Schwarzkopf s selection of seven of her own recordings This record was subsequently beaten by British pianist Dame Moura Lympany on her second appearance on the programme on July when all eight of her selections were of her own recordings br In the early s Alistair MacLean was chosen as a guest but the head of the European wing of the Ontario Tourist Bureau who had the same name was accidentally invited instead Plomley realised the error while conversing with MacLean shortly before they were set to record the programme Without any time to find another guest the interview was completed but it was never broadcast br In January Princess Margaret appeared as a castaway on the show br br br Opening theme br Plomley originally wanted the sounds of surf breaking on a shore and the cries of sea birds to open and close each programme However Leslie Prowne the head of popular record programmes at the BBC was concerned that it lacked definition and insisted that music should also be used Plomley and the series producer Frederic Piffard selected By the Sleepy Lagoon composed by Eric Coates who appeared on the show in The tune has been used since the first transmission in The sound of herring gulls has accompanied the music except for a period of time in when tropical bird sounds were used br br br Copyright status br Until late September Desert Island Discs could not be heard on the BBC s iPlayer service which allows most programmes to be heard up to a week after transmission The programme s website stated that this was due to rights issues as explained in The Sunday Times in br It was announced on September that an agreement had been reached as a result of which the programme would be available to stream via the iPlayer The first episode available through the iPlayer was with Barry Manilow Subsequently the programme was also made available as a podcast beginning with the edition broadcast on November which featured Morrissey However due to music clearance issues the music selections on the podcast versions are reduced to only playing for around seconds or so and in rare instances are unavailable as mentioned in an announcement made by the presenter at the appropriate point of the programme br On March the BBC placed more than episodes from the show s archive online to listen to via iPlayer Other episodes have since been added both new and old br In the early years of the BBC programmes were broadcast live and were not usually recorded This in addition to the BBC s policy of only retaining a limited number of broadcasts means very few episodes from the first years of the show are known to exist the earliest episode still in existence was broadcast on April and features actress Margaret Lockwood Several extracts were preserved for posterity at the request of the guests such as an extract featuring Alfred Hitchcock where he speaks about his films The Pleasure Garden and Rebecca gives his view on the changing landscape of the film industry and briefly discusses his then forthcoming film Psycho br In over recordings previously thought to be lost were rediscovered by the audio collector Richard Harrison These recordings date from the period to and feature many notable celebrities of the era including Bing Crosby Margot Fonteyn and James Stewart These recordings have been made available for streaming via BBC Sounds the successor to iPlayer for audio content In an additional episode featuring Veronica Wedgwood
