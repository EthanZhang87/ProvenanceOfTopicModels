and Liverpool were not traditional rivals meeting first for the first time on December at Anfield in the Football League First Division which ended in a win for Chelsea However for the next years Chelsea would only manage one single league title which came in whereas Liverpool who were already two time champions would go on to win the First Division title sixteen more times cementing the Reds status as one of the biggest clubs in England along with major rivals Manchester United whereas Chelsea were considered to be a mid table club and their rivalry with Liverpool was non existent during the years leading up to br br We were the new kids on the block who had a few quid and signed a load of players Jos Mourinho puffed his chest out and then we kept playing each other It was a clash of two ideals br The seeds of the Chelsea vs Liverpool were beginning to be sowed in May The first major meeting that would spark this feud was on the final day of the Premier League season Chelsea th faced Liverpool th at Stamford Bridge Both teams at this point were level on points with Chelsea having superior goal difference The three teams that were above them Manchester United st Arsenal nd and Newcastle United rd had already accumulated enough points to qualify for next season s Champions League and Blackburn Rovers th were unable to qualify meaning the winner of this game would qualify for the Champions League next season A goal from Sami Hyypi in the th minute put Liverpool up but Chelsea equalised just two minutes later through Marcel Desailly Fourteen minutes later Chelsea found themselves ahead via a Jesper Gr nkj r strike Steven Gerrard was dismissed two minutes from full time as Chelsea won and ensured their place in the Champions League next season with Liverpool having to settle for UEFA Cup now Europa League football instead br In July long time chairman of Chelsea Ken Bates sold the club to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for Chelsea spent on transfers in the summer of which included the signings of Joe Cole from West Ham United and Hern n Crespo from Inter Milan Unlike the previous years Chelsea under Abramovich had now become serious title contenders threatening the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal who combined had won ten of the first eleven Premier League titles br The first meeting between Chelsea and Liverpool after the Abramovich takeover was on the first matchday of the new campaign at Anfield Chelsea won courtesy of goals from Juan Sebasti n Ver n and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink Liverpool would get revenge in the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge in January which saw Bruno Cheyrou condemn Chelsea to a home defeat However despite the mass spend of Chelsea they would still be unable to win the league finishing as runners up to the undefeated Arsenal Meanwhile Liverpool finished in fourth place nineteen points behind Chelsea but still qualifying for the Champions League br br In the summer of Chelsea and Liverpool had respectively appointed managers Jos Mourinho and Rafael Ben tez which was the beginning of a vicious rivalry between the pair In their first season as rivals they clashed five times including two Premier League victories for Mourinho both of which finished to Chelsea and both of those goals being scored by Joe Cole br br On February Liverpool faced Chelsea in the final of the Football League Cup This was Liverpool s tenth appearance in a Football League Cup final having won seven of them and losing twice For Chelsea this was their fourth appearance in the final winning the cup final in and and losing in Liverpool had defeated Millwall Middlesbrough Tottenham Hotspur and Watford en route to the final whereas Chelsea got past West Ham United Newcastle United West London rivals Fulham and Manchester United to get to the final br A crowd of at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff saw John Arne Riise score a volley inside the first minute to put Liverpool ahead They managed to hold on to this lead for minutes until Steven Gerrard headed into his own net to give Chelsea a lifeline Jos Mourinho was also made to watch from the stands after making a gesture to the Liverpool fans The score was at full time meaning it would be going to extra time Goals from Didier Drogba and Mateja Ke man put Chelsea up A goal from Antonio N ez a minute later reduced the deficit for Liverpool but were unable to score again as Chelsea won and the League Cup for the third time br Following the match Mourinho defended the gesture that saw him dismissed claiming that it had been intended for the media and not Liverpool fans The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea Wait don t speak too soon We lost two matches and in my opinion you the media try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special It s just one more I had a few before this I m very happy to win It s important for the fans for the club and especially for the players br br Just two months after the League Cup final the two clubs met yet again in the semi finals of the Champions League The first leg at Stamford Bridge ended in a goalless stalemate however in the second leg at Anfield Liverpool controversially won thanks to a goal scored by Luis Garc a which despite Chelsea s attempts to clear the ball off the line the goal was given It was dubbed as a ghost goal by Jos Mourinho which popularised the term for other future incidents This would seal Liverpool s place in the Champions League final where they would take on AC Milan coming back from down and winning the Champions League on penalties br Prior to the match Chelsea were in hot pursuit of Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard Liverpool had rejected a bid from Chelsea however in a shocking turn of events Gerrard had rejected a a week contract offer and had submitted a transfer request just six weeks after inspiring the comeback to help Liverpool win the Champions League He eventually changed his mind soon after signing a new four year deal and later stating that he would rather win one Premier League title at Liverpool than multiple at Chelsea as it would mean more to him Chelsea s failed signing of Liverpool s elite poster boy resulted in yet more bad blood developing between the two sets of supporters br As for the Premier League season Chelsea were runaway winners winning their first Premier League title second overall finishing twelve points clear of second placed London rivals Arsenal They amassed a then record setting points also winning games both broken by Manchester City in and conceding goals a record that still stands to this day as the best defensive record in Premier League history Liverpool meanwhile finished fifth a regression from the previous season behind their Merseyside derby rivals Everton who finished fourth and points behind Chelsea However this also meant that despite being the winners of the Champions League they were not guaranteed a place in next season s edition as they had finished outside of the top four of the Premier League On June UEFA decided to grant Liverpool special dispensation to defend their title however they would have to enter the Champions League in the first qualifying round and were denied country protection which meant they could face any English team Chelsea Arsenal Manchester United or Everton at any stage of the competition br Liverpool would go on to defeat The New Saints FBK Kaunas and CSKA Sofia in the Champions League first second and third qualifying rounds respectively to advance to the group stage where they were drawn in Group G along with Chelsea Anderlecht and Real Betis although both of their matches against Chelsea were draws Liverpool would finish top of the group with points with Chelsea finishing second just behind the Reds with Mourinho s Chelsea would manage to get the better of Liverpool in their Premier League clashes defeating them away at Anfield in October which made them the first Premier League opposition team to score four goals at Anfield replicated by Arsenal in and Manchester City in and also beating them at Stamford Bridge in February However Ben tez s Liverpool were victorious in their semi final encounter in the FA Cup winning ending Chelsea s hopes for their first ever double and progressing to the FA Cup final where Steven Gerrard would score an equaliser in added time to help Liverpool defeat West Ham United on penalties After the match Mourinho refused to shake Benitez s hand and claimed that the best team had lost pointing to his side s superior league position stating Did the best team win I don t think so In a one off game maybe they will surprise me and they can do it In the Premiership the distance between the teams is points over two seasons br In the Premier League Chelsea would win the Premier League for a second consecutive season finishing on points whereas Liverpool who were also title contenders throughout the season as well finished third on points a point behind fierce rivals Manchester United who were second and points behind Chelsea br br As Chelsea and Liverpool were the respective winners of the Premier League and the FA Cup this meant that they would be playing each other in the FA Community Shield on August at the Millennium Stadium Cardiff the same venue that hosted the Football League Cup final a year and a half prior which saw Chelsea beat Liverpool Chelsea were the defending champions having beaten their London rivals Arsenal the previous year The Blues were making their sixth appearance in the Community Shield having also won in and and losing in and Liverpool on the other hand were appearing for the st time emerging outright victorious eight times sharing the shield six times and losing it six times In the match John Arne Riise opened the scoring for Liverpool early in the first half only for Chelsea s recently signed forward Andriy Shevchenko to equalise shortly before half time Both sides had chances to win the match in the second half but a Peter Crouch goal late in the half ensured Liverpool won the match to win the Community Shield for the th time br br The two teams were again drawn against each other in the Champions League squaring off in the semi finals of the competition Chelsea would win the first leg at Stamford Bridge courtesy of a goal from Joe Cole but Liverpool won the second leg as well at Anfield with Daniel Agger ensuring the tie finished on aggregate The team that would progress was decided in a penalty shootout Liverpool would win the penalty shootout sending them to their second Champions League final in three years which would be a rematch of the edition which saw AC Milan get their revenge on Liverpool and defeat them br The following season saw Jos Mourinho depart from Chelsea in September but they would still defeat Liverpool in the quarter finals of the League Cup with goals from Frank Lampard and Andriy Shevchenko sending the Reds crashing out of the competition Chelsea and Liverpool were drawn against each other yet again in the semi finals of the Champions League In the first leg at Anfield a Dirk Kuyt goal two minutes before half time put Liverpool ahead and held onto the lead until the th minute which saw John Arne Riise put the ball in his own net to give Chelsea who were now being managed by Avram Grant an advantage with the match finishing and the Blues heading into the second leg at Stamford Bridge with a crucial away goal Chelsea would defeat Liverpool with a brace from Didier Drogba and an emotional penalty from Frank Lampard seeing Chelsea finally get the better of Liverpool in the Champions League and sending them to their first ever Champions League final which they would go on to lose on penalties to Manchester United br br On October Chelsea hosted Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in the ninth game of the new Premier League campaign At this point Chelsea were top of the Premier League and Liverpool were second with both teams having points and Chelsea having superior goal difference Chelsea were also unbeaten in their last games at home last losing against Arsenal dating back to February and were looking to extend their lead at the top of the table and their home unbeaten run to games In surprising fashion however Liverpool managed to defeat Chelsea with a th minute strike from Xabi Alonso that deflected off Chelsea defender Jos Bosingwa sending the Reds to the top of the Premier League and ending the Blues record setting game home unbeaten run their first home league defeat for over four and half years which is still the record for the most home games unbeaten in the Premier League In the reverse fixture at Anfield in February Liverpool defeated Chelsea again this time winning with both goals coming from Fernando Torres late in the game This was the first season in Premier League history that Liverpool had completed a Premier League double over Chelsea They would also finish second above Chelsea who finished third making it the first Premier League season since where Liverpool would finish above Chelsea in the Premier League table br In the quarter finals of the Champions League Liverpool and Chelsea were drawn against each other again marking the fifth consecutive season in which they played together in the Champions League the most in Champions League history In the first leg at Anfield Chelsea emphatically won with two goals from defender Branislav Ivanovi and a goal from Didier Drogba giving Chelsea an advantage in the second leg at Stamford Bridge which saw both teams play out a thrilling draw with Chelsea winning on aggregate and progressing to the semi finals of the Champions League From to Chelsea and Liverpool met a staggering times br br After Rafael Ben tez departed from Liverpool in June the club struggled greatly under new manager Roy Hodgson which saw them nine out of their first twenty matches in the Premier League and sitting th in the table and one of the players who struggled was elite Spanish striker Fernando Torres Despite Torres having a successful three and a half seasons at Liverpool which saw him score goals in nearly appearances he failed to win a single trophy at the club Chelsea had previously expressed interest in signing Torres in but Torres responded by saying it would be many years before he left Liverpool On January Liverpool rejected a bid from Chelsea for Torres which was followed by Torres handing in a transfer request the next day which was also rejected Chelsea finally completed the signing of Torres on January for a then British transfer record and making Torres the sixth most expensive player in football history at the time with the signing enraging Liverpool fans and boiling the blood in the rivalry even further br Ironically Torres made his Chelsea debut against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on February where was he was greeted with flags and signs held up by Liverpool fans labelling him as a traitor Liverpool would go on to beat Chelsea with a th minute goal from Raul Meireles putting Fernando Torres Chelsea debut in vain br The next season s edition of the Premier League saw both Chelsea and Liverpool underperform with both teams finishing outside of the top four which in normal circumstances would have saw them both absent from Europe entirely next season with Chelsea who finished sixth qualifying for the Champions League as the Champions League winners which also put their fierce London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who finished fourth in the nightmare scenario of finishing in the top four and still not qualifying for the Champions League who had to settle for Europa League football instead Meanwhile Liverpool who finished th qualified for the third qualifying round of the Europa League as the runners up of the FA Cup However Liverpool still managed to do a Premier League double over Chelsea defeating them both home and away which included a humiliation at Anfield in May br br On May Chelsea and Liverpool faced off in the final of the FA Cup for the very first time at Wembley Stadium Chelsea were looking to win their first trophy of the season being managed by interim manager Roberto Di Matteo who was prosperous about being appointed as Chelsea manager on a permanent basis Meanwhile Liverpool who were being managed by club legend Kenny Dalglish had already won the

United Brighton Hove Albion Stoke City and Merseyside rivals Everton to earn their place in the final br In the match Ramires put Chelsea in front in the th minute after he dispossessed Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing and beat Pepe Reina in the Liverpool area Chelsea extended their lead in the nd minute when striker Didier Drogba scored Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll scored in the th minute to reduce the deficit to one goal Carroll thought he had scored a second in the st minute but his header was saved on the line by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr ech Carroll ran off celebrating thinking he had equalised and the ball had crossed the line but referee Phil Dowd did not award a goal unlike the Luis Garc a ghost goal seven years prior and Chelsea held on to win the match and the FA Cup for the seventh time br br On April during Liverpool s draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield Liverpool striker Luis Su rez bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovi This was not the first time that something like this had happened it was the second time that Su rez had bitten an opponent It was not noticed by the officials and Su rez scored an equalizer in injury time The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Su rez the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club Contrary to claims from Su rez Ivanovi did not accept an apology Su rez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA s claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence A three man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten game ban for Su rez who did not appeal the ban the panel criticized Su rez for not appreciating the seriousness of the incident when he argued against a long ban The panel also wanted to send a strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football while noting that all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models have the duty to act professionally and responsibly and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game especially to young players br The Premier League season saw Chelsea Liverpool Arsenal and Manchester City battle it out in a four way title race which eventually boiled down to Chelsea Liverpool and City Chelsea did the Premier League double over all three of their title opponents but inconsistent form and losses against the low block teams saw them fail to win the Premier League br br On April Liverpool now managed by Brendan Rodgers welcomed Chelsea now managed by a returning Jos Mourinho to Anfield At this point the high flying Reds were top of the Premier League on points with just three games to go five points clear of second placed Chelsea and six of third placed Manchester City who had a game in hand They had also scored nearly a century of Premier League goals and were on course to win their first ever Premier League title which would have happened if they were to win their last three games which were Chelsea at home Crystal Palace away and Newcastle United at home Additionally a win against Chelsea would have seen the Blues be unable to catch Liverpool as they would have been eight points behind them with two games left br The match saw Steven Gerrard infamously slip while receiving a pass in first half injury time which allowed Demba Ba to score for Chelsea and put them up at Anfield Liverpool ultimately were unable to equalise as a goal from Willian in the dying moments of the game saw Chelsea run out winners with Liverpool only now being two points clear of their rivals from London and three points of clear of Manchester City who had a game in hand and had superior goal difference Liverpool followed this up by throwing away a lead at Crystal Palace and only managing to come out with a draw all but confirming Manchester City s Premier League victory br br The next season Chelsea hosted Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on May who at this point had been top of the Premier League for every single matchday The match finished with the goals coming from John Terry and Steven Gerrard In the match Gerrard who had confirmed a few months prior that he would be departing from Liverpool at the end of the season received a standing ovation from both the Liverpool and Chelsea fans as he was being substituted off In a post match interview Gerrard had mixed feelings about being clapped off the pitch by Chelsea fans stating I was more happy with the ovation from the Liverpool fans I think Chelsea fans have showed respect for a couple of seconds for me but they ve slaughtered me all game so I m not going to get drawn into wishing the Chelsea fans very well It was nice of them to turn up for once today But yeah you know when you get a standing ovation at a stadium it s nice but what s important to me is the support from the Liverpool fans and they ve been with me since day one br br Since then the rivalry has cooled down a little bit though fans of both clubs still hold a dislike for each other Liverpool now under J rgen Klopp would beat Chelsea in three successive major finals during this period the UEFA Super Cup the EFL Cup final and the FA Cup final all on penalties as well as finally winning their first Premier League title in the season The two clubs met again in the
