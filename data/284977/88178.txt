The UEFA Cup Winners Cup was a European football club competition contested annually by the winners of domestic cup competitions The cup was chronologically the second seasonal inter European club competition organised by UEFA The tournament ran for seasons with the final edition held in after which it was discontinued br The first tournament was held in but it was organised by the Mitropa Cup s Organising Committee and not recognised by the governing body of European football until when it was accepted as a UEFA competition on the initiative of the Italian Football Federation FIGC br From onwards the winner of the tournament progressed to play the winner of the European Cup later the UEFA Champions League in the European Super Cup Since the abolition of the UEFA Cup Winners Cup the UEFA Super Cup place previously reserved for the Cup Winners Cup winner has been taken by the winner of the UEFA Cup now the UEFA Europa League The competition s official name was originally the European Cup Winners Cup it was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners Cup in br br br Format br Throughout its year history the Cup Winners Cup was always a straight knock out tournament with two legged home and away ties until the single match final staged at a neutral venue the only exception to this being the two legged final in the competition s first year In common with other UEFA club tournaments the away goals rule was applied when aggregate scores were tied The format was identical to the original European Champions Cup with teams contesting four knock out rounds prior to the showpiece final with the tournament usually running from September to May each year Following the influx of new UEFA member nations during the s a regular August preliminary round was added to reduce the number of entrants to br Entry was restricted to one club from each UEFA member association the only exception being to allow the current Cup Winners Cup holders to enter alongside their nation s new domestic cup winners in order to allow them a chance to defend their Cup Winners Cup title although no club ever managed to do this However if this team also qualified for the European Champions Cup then they would default on their place in the Cup Winners Cup and no other team would replace them If a domestic cup holder also wins the Cup Winners Cup in the same season the domestic cup runner up will take that association s berth br On occasions when a club completed a domestic league and cup double that club would enter the European Cup UEFA Champions League and their place in the Cup Winners Cup would be taken by the domestic cup runners up In the competition s final year Heerenveen of the Netherlands entered the Cup Winners Cup despite only reaching the semi final of the previous season s KNVB Cup This was due to both KNVB Cup finalists Ajax and PSV Eindhoven qualifying for the recently expanded Champions League br br br History br br br Early tournaments br The earliest events where cup holders from different countries met were the friendly games nicknamed world championships at the end of the th century between English and Scottish cup holders The respective leagues were yet established and therefore the first two editions involved meetings between cup holders the fourth edition involved cup holders as well won by Aston Villa Renton and Heart of Midlothian respectively exception being the edition where English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian br br br Inauguration and prestige br Mirroring the circumstances behind the creation of the European Cup five years earlier the idea for a pan European cup competition contested by all of Europe s domestic cup winners came from prominent European sports journalists The European Cup had proven to be a great success and the Fairs Cup had also proven popular as a result other ideas for new European football tournaments were being aired One proposal was for a tournament based upon the format of the European Cup but with national cup winners rather than league champions taking part which could run alongside that competition br br The inaugural Cup Winners Cup was held in the season and was a semi official pilot tournament However the initial reaction to the competition s creation was unenthusiastic on the part of many of Europe s top clubs many European associations did not have domestic cup competitions at the time and in those countries that did the cup competition was generally held in low esteem and often not taken seriously by the bigger clubs It was essentially only in England Scotland and to a lesser extent Germany and Spain that the domestic cup was considered especially prestigious Many were sceptical about the viability of a European tournament for cup winners and many of the bigger clubs eligible to contest the first CWC turned down the chance to enter such as Atl tico Madrid of Spain and AS Monaco of France br Ultimately the inaugural CWC was contested by just clubs with Fiorentina of Italy winning the two legged final against the Scottish team Rangers but the games were generally well attended and the response from the public and the media to the new tournament was positive and enthusiastic For the tournament s second season in UEFA took over the running of all aspects of the competition and this time all the clubs eligible to enter accepted the opportunity br br By all UEFA member nations had set up domestic cup competitions due to the success of the Cup Winners Cup UEFA regarded it as the second most prestigious competition behind the European Cup later the UEFA Champions League and ahead of the Fairs Cup later the UEFA Cup Therefore a team qualified for both the European Cup and the Cup Winners Cup would play in the European Cup whereas a team qualified for both the UEFA Cup and the Cup Winners Cup would play in the Cup Winners Cup Nevertheless many commentators and fans regarded the Cup Winners Cup as weaker than the UEFA Cup which had more and better teams from the stronger European leagues br In the season English clubs were banned from European competition as a result of Heysel Stadium disaster Consequently Manchester United Everton Coventry City Wimbledon and Liverpool were prevented from competing in the Cup Winners Cup until the beginning of the season br No club managed to retain the Cup Winners Cup although eight times a winning side followed up their victories with a losing appearance in the following season s final br br br Decline br After the establishment of the UEFA Champions League formerly called the European Champion Clubs Cup in the early s the standing and prestige of the Cup Winners Cup began to decline With the expansion of the Champions League in to allow more than one team from the highest ranked member associations to enter the Cup Winners Cup began to look noticeably inferior Many of the bigger teams who would previously have entered the Cup Winners Cup were now gaining entry to the Champions League instead by finishing second in their domestic league such as Cup Winners Cup holders Barcelona in and Bayern Munich and PSV Eindhoven in and this greatly weakened the Cup Winners Cup br At the time of the Champions League expansion UEFA also considered expanding the Cup Winners Cup from teams to by allowing a second team to enter from many countries although by what qualification criteria the second entrants would be determined were never settled upon ultimately UEFA did not make any of these changes to the Cup Winners Cup br By the late s the Cup Winners Cup had come to be seen as a second rate competition with only one or two big name teams available to enter each year and the interest in the tournament from both major clubs and the public dropped Finally with the further expansion of the UEFA Champions League to include as many as three or four teams from the top footballing nations the decision was taken to abolish the competition after the end of the tournament and merge it into the UEFA Cup now the UEFA Europa League Since then domestic cup winners who do not otherwise qualify for the Champions League are given a place in the Europa League br br br The trophy br The Cup Winners Cup trophy itself is a property of UEFA and it is not assigned to any club though clubs were allowed to have replicas made There were various versions of the trophy awarded throughout its history The first was only awarded in its maiden season to Fiorentina The appearance of the second trophy differed significantly from the successor versions The third and the fourth trophy differed only in the type of base The wooden based trophy was awarded to the winners during the s with exception of when the special version with a metal base was awarded to
