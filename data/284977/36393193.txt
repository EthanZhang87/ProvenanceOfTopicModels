during Fagan s first season as manager winning the League championship for the third year in succession the Football League Cup for the fourth year in succession and a fourth European Cup The following season the club was involved in one of the worst disasters to occur at a football stadium Before the start of the European Cup Final against Juventus Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse killing fans mostly Italians The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster and resulted in the expulsion of English clubs from European competition for five years br br br rebuilding br br Huddersfield Town s Bill Shankly was appointed Liverpool manager midway through the season He was approached by Liverpool chairman T V Williams who asked Shankly if he would like to manage the best club in the country to which he replied Why is Matt Busby packing up A perceived lack of ambition at Huddersfield Town and the potential at Liverpool led Shankly to accept the offer When he arrived the club was in the Second Division having played at this level since relegation in During his first season in charge Shankly gave debuts to two players Ian Callaghan who would go on to become the club s record appearance maker and Roger Hunt the club s future leading goalscorer in the League br Despite their introduction Shankly s impact was not immediate as the club finished the season in third place outside the promotion spots Shankly had been musing on which players to keep and which to move on and he eventually decided that players should be released by the end of his first season they had all left the club Shankly retained the existing backroom staff and converted a boot storage room into a meeting place where he and his coaches could discuss strategy The Boot Room as it came to be known was to be an integral part of the club s future success Bob Paisley was clear on the significance of the Boot Room You got a more wide ranging discussion in the Boot Room than the boardroom What went on was kept within those four walls There was a certain mystique about the place br The club again finished third the following season despite a run of games without defeat defeats in the opening matches had cost Liverpool the chance of promotion Shareholder John Moores believed the club needed to spend more money on players to be successful and encouraged chairman T V Williams to do so The following season Shankly signed Ian St John from Motherwell and Ron Yeats from Dundee United Shankly was confident his signings would be a success challenging the board of directors to sack me if they can t play St John and Yeats helped the club win promotion to the First Division they won the Second Division with points and were unbeaten at their home ground Anfield all season Liverpool were back in the First Division for the first time in eight years in Despite an uneasy start they were in fifth place by March after a match unbeaten run Liverpool s form suffered following their loss to Leicester City in the FA Cup semi final and a poor run of results including a defeat to Tottenham Hotspur saw the club finish the season in eighth place br br The following season Shankly signed Peter Thompson from Preston North End as he could play wide on the right hand side of midfield Liverpool started poorly garnering only nine points from the first nine games A victory over Everton their first win over their local rivals since instigated Liverpool s move up the table They won points from their next games to secure their sixth League championship Success led to the average attendance at Anfield increasing to more than The fans also became more vocal and it was around this time that the fans on the Kop adopted You ll Never Walk Alone as their anthem br Liverpool s League championship qualified them to participate in European competition for the first time in the European Cup For their second round tie against Belgian team Anderlecht Shankly decided to change from red shirts white shorts and socks to an all red kit Shankly felt the players would be more intimidating to the opposition as a result Liverpool reached the semi final but were beaten by Italian club Internazionale The tie was not without controversy Shankly felt that the referee showed bias towards Internazionale as he had allowed questionable goals by the Italians to stand Liverpool s form in the European Cup carried over into the FA Cup in which they reached the final against Leeds United The game was goalless for the first minutes but Liverpool took the lead in extra time courtesy of a goal by Hunt Leeds equalised shortly afterwards but a St John goal secured a victory for Liverpool and their first FA Cup triumph Liverpool s form in cup competitions did not translate to their performance in the League as the defence of their championship ended with the club finishing in seventh place br br br stability br br Victory in the FA Cup meant Liverpool would participate in the European Cup Winners Cup during They went one stage further than the previous season as they reached the final facing German team Borussia Dortmund The two sides were level at at the end of minutes and the match went into extra time Liverpool were unable to score and conceded a goal to Dortmund who won the match Shankly was unimpressed with his team s performance stating We didn t play well and we gave away two silly goals Their defence of the FA Cup ended in the third round after defeat to Chelsea Their lack of success in cup competitions was offset by regaining the League championship on the last day of April when they beat Chelsea courtesy of two goals from Hunt br The next few seasons were not as successful A return to the European Cup in saw Liverpool eliminated on aggregate by Dutch side Ajax in the second round The League campaign was equally disappointing as the team finished the season in fifth place winning only of their last games One significant event during the season was the arrival of future captain Emlyn Hughes from Blackpool for a fee The season started well with Liverpool league leaders through much of September October and November An accumulation of matches due to participation in the Inter Cities Fairs Cup FA Cup and Football League Cup impacted negatively on Liverpool s League form They finished the season in third place behind champions Manchester City The games Liverpool played during the season did not result in success The furthest the club progressed in any competition was the quarter final of the FA Cup br The following season saw an improvement in League form but there was no reward Poor performances in the cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season but that did not translate into a League championship as they finished in second place six points behind Leeds United Shankly s team was beginning to age and several players had moved on or retired Gerry Byrne who had been the club s left back for seasons retired after making appearances Shankly now had the task of replacing the players in his squad He started the process with the purchase of Hughes and then Ray Clemence the season before but his signings did not always work out Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of from Chelsea but injury and poor form meant he was sold to Coventry City after a year During the season Shankly signed Alun Evans for from Wolverhampton Wanderers a record fee for a teenager at the time Despite a good start Evans suffered a series of injuries that cut his career short br The season was the beginning of a transitional period for Liverpool as players such as Hunt St John and Yeats made their last appearances for the club A sixth round loss to Watford in the FA Cup convinced Shankly that some of his older players should be moved on Liverpool nevertheless started the season well and were unbeaten in their first ten League matches until a defeat to Manchester United They were unable to maintain their early season form and finished in fifth place Success in the other cup competitions was not forthcoming as Liverpool exited in the early rounds of the Football League Cup and Inter Cities Fairs Cup br br br transition br Shankly s new squad began to take shape during with many of the young players he had signed playing in the first team As a result the average age of the team was Players such as Clemence Steve Heighway Alec Lindsay and Larry Lloyd began to establish themselves in the team John Toshack was also signed from Cardiff City to replace Hunt Liverpool were unable to improve upon the previous season s League position finishing in fifth place but they had more success in cup competitions They reached the semi finals of the Inter Cities Fairs Cup but lost to Leeds United over two legs Liverpool progressed to the final of the FA Cup and played Arsenal Although Liverpool took the lead in extra time after a goalless minutes Arsenal won to complete a League and cup double br br Before the final against Arsenal Shankly signed Kevin Keegan from Scunthorpe United Keegan became a key player for Liverpool and his impact was immediate as he scored minutes into his Liverpool debut The addition of Keegan almost helped Liverpool regain the League championship They went into the final day of the season a point behind Derby County who had already finished their campaign but were unable to secure the victory they needed against Arsenal finishing in third place The season was when Shankly s new Liverpool team delivered winning the League and the club s first European trophy the UEFA Cup They started the season well and were top of the League after a victory over Sheffield United They maintained that position throughout the remainder of the season securing the League championship after a draw against Leicester City It was the club s eighth League title equalling the record held by Arsenal Further success followed in the UEFA Cup as the club reached the final against German team Borussia M nchengladbach A victory in the first leg and a loss in the second leg meant Liverpool won the tie on aggregate claiming their first European trophy They became the first English team to win the League and a European trophy in the same season br John Smith became chairman in his appointment was based around his business experience with the idea of developing of a more corporate approach to the club s decision making He believed in continuity and ended the club s policy of changing chairman every three years The biggest development at Anfield in recent years occurred in as the old Main Stand was demolished and a new one constructed The stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on March Their triumph in the League meant Liverpool would compete in the European Cup They were not as successful as the previous season and were eliminated in the second round by Yugoslav team Red Star Belgrade Liverpool made a poor start to their League campaign losing early on to Coventry City and Derby County as opposed to Leeds United who were unbeaten in their first games of the season Liverpool reduced the gap but a poor end to the season in which they won only one of their last eight matches meant they finished second to Leeds Despite their lack of success in other competitions Liverpool reached the final of the FA Cup beating Newcastle United to win the cup for the second time Shankly bought Ray Kennedy from Arsenal at the end of the season which was his last act as Liverpool manager He resigned soon afterwards citing the need for a break and was replaced by his assistant Bob Paisley br Shankly continued to turn up at Melwood the club s training ground where the players still referred to him as boss Reluctantly Paisley asked him to stay away from training in order to assert his authority as manager Liverpool started well they were unbeaten in their first six League matches and recorded their biggest ever win when they beat Str msgodset in the European Cup Winners Cup Liverpool were nevertheless knocked out by Hungarian side Ferencv ros on the away goals rule in the next round The club s participation in domestic cup competitions ended early as well being eliminated in the fourth round in the FA Cup and Football League Cup Liverpool s good start to the season in the League was not sustained and they eventually finished in second place Paisley made some important signings during the course of the season He signed Phil Neal Terry McDermott and Jimmy Case who would become regulars in the successful team that Paisley was to build br br br sustained success br br The season did not start well as Liverpool lost to Queens Park Rangers in their first match Their form had not improved by mid October by which time they had won only six of their first twelve matches Liverpool s form picked up in the second half of the season a late season run in which they dropped only one point in nine matches left them a point behind Queens Park Rangers going into their final match Victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers would secure the League championship as Queens Park Rangers had already finished their league campaign The match did not start well and Liverpool were a goal behind at half time but won the match with three second half goals to win the League championship Liverpool were eliminated early from the FA Cup and League Cup but fared better in Europe progressing to the final of the UEFA Cup A aggregate victory over Belgian team Club Brugge meant the club won the trophy for the second time br Before the start of Keegan

feeling that the European Cup is going to be next Liverpool started the season in good form losing only of their first games in the League a run that put them top by September A blip during the Christmas period which included a defeat to Aston Villa did not prevent Liverpool from winning their tenth League championship Liverpool were again successful in Europe reaching the final of the European Cup for the first time and beating Borussia M nchengladbach to become the champions of Europe Paisley s team were denied a treble of trophies when they lost the FA Cup final to Manchester United br Keegan had been sold to German club Hamburg for a fee before the start of Paisley signed Kenny Dalglish from Celtic as Keegan s replacement His impact was immediate as he scored goals in league games Dalglish scored the winning goal in Liverpool s victory over Club Brugge in the European Cup Final as the club retained the trophy becoming the first British team to do so Despite their success in Europe Liverpool were unsuccessful in domestic competitions They finished seven points behind Nottingham Forest in the League who were also their opponents in the Football League Cup Final After ending the match went to a replay which Nottingham Forest won br Liverpool began in contrasting fashion They were drawn against Nottingham Forest in the first round of the European Cup and were eliminated after a aggregate defeat There was also an early exit from the League Cup as they lost to Sheffield United in the second round But those setbacks were offset by Liverpool s start in the League they won their first six games and did not lose until their twelfth a loss to Everton Their form continued over the season and they won the League finishing eight points ahead of Nottingham Forest Their performance in the League broke several records the points they gained surpassed the earned by Leeds United in The goals conceded was another record br Liverpool retained the League championship in the following season Despite early defeats to Southampton and Nottingham Forest they were top by January and stayed there for the remainder of the season A victory over Aston Villa in the penultimate game of the season secured the League championship Key to the club s success was their home form they were unbeaten at Anfield all season and only conceded eight goals Their impressive form in the League did not translate to Europe as Liverpool were knocked out in the first round of the European Cup by Soviet team Dinamo Tbilisi They fared better in the FA Cup and League Cup but were unable to progress past the semi final stage in either competition During the season Liverpool became the first British club to wear the name of a sponsor Hitachi on their shirts Chairman John Smith was clear about the club s need for extra income The days are gone when a club like ours can control its destiny on the money coming through the turnstiles br The season was a contrast to previous seasons as the club struggled in the League but excelled in cup competitions Despite losing games the same as eventual winners Aston Villa Liverpool drew to finish in fifth place their worst position for years Liverpool s form in the cups was much better an early elimination in the FA Cup withstanding they reached the finals of the Football League Cup and European Cup They won the Football League Cup for the first time beating West Ham United in a replay after the final ended in a draw Real Madrid were Liverpool s opponents in the European Cup Final and they won the competition for the third time courtesy of an Alan Kennedy goal in a victory br br br triumph and tragedy br br Following their fifth place League finish the previous season Liverpool were eager to regain the League championship Their goalkeeper Clemence had signed for Tottenham Hotspur and was replaced by Bruce Grobbelaar Liverpool did not perform well in their early games losing their first match and drawing several others Their poor form continued and by the end of December they had won only of games and were in the bottom half of the League Their form in the second half of the season improved and a run of successive wins towards the end of the season meant they won the League with four points more than Ipswich Town Liverpool retained the League championship in winning the title points ahead of Watford Liverpool were eliminated from the FA Cup and European Cup in the fifth round and quarter final respectively but were successful in the Football League Cup A victory over Manchester United in the final meant Liverpool won the competition for the third year in succession Before the start of the season Paisley had announced his intention to retire from management aged Paisley had won six League championships three European Cups and League Cups during his reign making him the most successful manager in the club s history He was replaced by his assistant Joe Fagan br Liverpool continued their success into as they won three competitions to secure a unique treble The club began the campaign indifferently but by November they were top of the table and stayed there to win the League three points ahead of Southampton As a result they equalled the record of three consecutive League championships held by Huddersfield Town and Arsenal Key to their success was striker Ian Rush who scored goals over the league campaign and a further in other competitions Liverpool again reached the final of the Football League Cup where they faced Everton A draw in the first match at Wembley Stadium meant that the match was replayed at Maine Road the following week A Graeme Souness goal secured a victory and the club s fourth successive League Cup triumph Liverpool performed well in Europe reaching the final of the European Cup They faced Italian team Roma at their home stadium the Stadio Olimpico A draw after minutes and extra time meant the match went to a penalty shoot out which Liverpool won Alan Kennedy scored the winning penalty after Grobbelaar had distracted Roma player Francesco Graziani causing him to miss his own penalty br br Fagan s second season in charge was less successful as Liverpool failed to win a trophy for the first time in nine years The defence of their League championship was all but over in October when Liverpool were in the relegation places The club s form picked up afterwards but they were unable to catch Everton and finished points behind in second place Their defence of the Football League Cup ended in the third round and Fagan s team played no further part in the FA Cup after defeat to Manchester United at the semi final Liverpool did fare better in Europe reaching their fifth European Cup final Before the match against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium commenced Liverpool fans had breached a fence separating the two sets of supporters As the Juventus fans fled to safety the accumulation of people against a perimeter wall caused it to collapse killing fans most of whom were Italians The collapse of the wall led to rioting by Juventus fans at the other end of the ground As a result the match was delayed by two hours but was played regardless as it was feared its abandonment would lead to further violence Juventus won the final br In the aftermath of the match the blame for the Heysel Stadium disaster was laid on the Liverpool fans UEFA official G nter Schneider stated Only the English fans were responsible Of that there is no doubt As a result The Football Association withdrew English clubs from European competition and two days later UEFA banned English clubs for an indeterminate period of time A condition was added stipulating that Liverpool would serve another three year ban once the ban on English clubs was lifted Fagan had decided to retire before the match he felt the team needed rebuilding and he was not the ideal man to do this with his th birthday approaching He was replaced by Dalglish
