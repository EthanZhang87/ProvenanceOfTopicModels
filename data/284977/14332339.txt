 Bring Me Sunshine is a song written in by the composer Arthur Kent with lyrics by Sylvia Dee It was first recorded by The Mills Brothers in on their album My Shy Violet In the UK the song is associated with the popular comedy duo Morecambe Wise after it was adopted as their signature tune in their second series for the BBC in br br br Musical influences br Professor of Critical Musicology at the University of Leeds Prof Derek B Scott argues that the song is influenced by the Viennese popular style He writes br br The melody implies a minor key with harmonies on the tonic and subdominant This would of course be bizarre and inappropriate for the words Bring me sunshine in Your Smile Bring me laughter all the while But we find that the tonality is actually the relative major of the key implied by the tune and the harmonies consist of the tonic with a free floating sixth and dominant ninth Suddenly the words and music make perfect sense the tension of the dissonances conveying the sense of an appeal for sunshine rather than the actual presence of sunshine br br br Morecambe Wise version br br br Skip dance br Although the second verse was often performed by an orchestra conducted by Peter Knight over the duo s closing credits they only ever sang the first verse the second one being purely instrumental with Eric and Ernie performing a skip dance to exit the stage The dance has been attributed to BBC producer John Ammonds and Eric s son Gary recalls that the inspiration for the skip dance came from a Groucho Marx film sequence br br br Morecambe Wise
