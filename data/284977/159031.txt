title: Cover version
id: 159031
In popular music a cover version cover song remake revival or simply cover is a new performance or recording by a musician other than the original performer or composer of the song Originally it referred to a version of a song released around the same time as the original in order to compete with it Now it refers to any subsequent version performed after the original br br The term cover goes back decades when cover version originally described a rival version of a tune recorded to compete with the recently released original version Examples of records covered include Paul Williams hit tune The Hucklebuck and Hank Williams song Jambalaya Both crossed over to the popular hit parade and had numerous hit versions Before the mid th century the notion of an original version of a popular tune would have seemed slightly odd the production of musical entertainment was seen as a live event even if it was reproduced at home via a copy of the sheet music learned by heart or captured on a gramophone record In fact one of the principal objects of publishing sheet music was to have a composition performed by as many artists as possible This made the song more important than the performing artist and rival cover or copycat versions would vie for success br In previous generations some artists made very successful careers of presenting revivals or reworkings of once popular tunes even out of doing contemporary cover versions of current hits Since the s musicians now play what they call cover versions the reworking updating or interpretation of songs as a tribute to the original performer or group Using familiar material such as evergreen hits standard tunes or classic recordings is an important method of learning music styles Until the mid s most albums or long playing records contained a large number of evergreens or standards to present a fuller range of the artist s abilities and style See for example Please Please Me Artists might also perform interpretations covers of a favorite artist s hit tunes for the simple pleasure of playing a familiar song or collection of tunes br Today three broad types of entertainers depend on cover versions for their principal repertoire br Tribute acts or bands are performers who make a living by recreating the music of one particular artist or band Bands such as Bj rn Again Led Zepagain The Fab Four Australian Pink Floyd Show and the Iron Maidens are dedicated to playing the music of ABBA Led Zeppelin The Beatles Pink Floyd and Iron Maiden respectively Some tribute acts salute the Who The Rolling Stones and many other classic rock acts Many tribute acts target artists who remain popular but no longer perform allowing an audience to experience the next best thing to the original act The formation of tribute acts is roughly proportional to the enduring popularity of the original act for example dozens of Beatles tribute bands have formed and an entire subindustry has formed around Elvis impersonation Many tribute bands attempt to recreate another band s music as faithfully as possible but some such bands introduce a twist Dread Zeppelin performs reggae versions of the Zeppelin catalog and Beatallica creates heavy metal fusions of songs by the Beatles and Metallica There are also situations in which a member of a tribute band will go on to greater success sometimes with the original act they tribute One notable example is Tim Ripper Owens who once the lead singer of Judas Priest tribute band British Steel went on to join Judas Priest himself br Cover acts or bands are entertainers who perform a broad variety of crowd pleasing cover songs for audiences who enjoy the familiarity of hit songs Such bands draw from either current Top hits or those of previous decades to provide nostalgic entertainment in bars on cruise ships and at such events as weddings family celebrations and corporate functions Since the advent of inexpensive computers some cover bands use a computerized catalog of songs so that the singer can have the lyrics to a song displayed on a computer screen The use of a screen for lyrics as a memory aid can dramatically increase the number of songs a singer can perform br Revivalist artists or bands are performers who are inspired by an entire genre of music and dedicate themselves to curating and recreating the genre and introducing it to younger audiences who have not experienced that music first hand Unlike tribute bands and cover bands who rely primarily on audiences seeking a nostalgic experience revivalist bands usually seek new young audiences for whom the music is fresh and has no nostalgic value For example Sha Na Na started in as a celebration of the doo wop music of the s a genre of music that was not initially fashionable during the hippie counter culture era The Blues Brothers started in as a living salute to the blues soul and R B music of the s and s that was not in vogue by the late s The Blues Brothers creed was that they were on a mission from God as evangelists for blues and soul music The Black Crowes formed in initially dedicated to reviving s style blues rock They started writing their own material in the same vein br br Since the Copyright Act of United States musicians have had the right to record a version of someone else s previously recorded and released tune whether it is music alone or music with lyrics A license can be negotiated between representatives of the interpreting artist and the copyright holder or recording published tunes can fall under a mechanical license whereby the recording artist pays a standard royalty to the original author copyright holder through an organization such as the Harry Fox Agency and is safe under copyright law even if they do not have any permission from the original author A similar service was provided by Limelight by RightsFlow until January when they announced they will be closing their service The U S Congress introduced the mechanical license to head off an attempt by the Aeolian Company to monopolize the piano roll market br Although a composer cannot deny anyone a mechanical license for a new recorded version the composer has the right to decide who will release the first recording of a song Bob Dylan took advantage of this right when he refused his own record company the right to release a live recording of Mr Tambourine Man Even with this pre release cover versions of songs can occasionally occur br Live performances of copyrighted songs are typically arranged through performing rights organizations such as ASCAP or BMI br br Early in the th century it became common for phonograph record labels record companies to have singers or musicians cover a commercially successful hit tune by recording a version for their own label in hopes of cashing in on the tune s success For example Ain t She Sweet was popularized in by Eddie Cantor on stage and by Ben Bernie and Gene Austin on record was repopularized through popular recordings by Mr Goon Bones Mr Ford and Pearl Bailey in and later still revived as and RPM records by the Beatles in br Because little promotion or advertising was done in the early days of record production other than at the local music hall or music store the average buyer purchasing a new record usually asked for the tune not the artist Record distribution was highly localized so a locally popular artist could quickly record a version of a hit song from another area and reach an audience before the version by the artist s who first introduced the tune and highly competitive record companies were quick to take advantage of this br br This began to change in the late s when the growing record buying public began including a younger age group During the swing era when a bobby soxer went looking for a recorded tune say In the Mood typically she wanted the version popularized by her favorite artist s e g the Glenn Miller version on RCA Victor s cheaper Bluebird label not someone else s sometimes presented on a more expensive record company s label This trend was marked closely by the charting of record sales by the different artists not just hit tunes on the music industry s Hit Parades However for sound commercial reasons record companies still continued to record different versions of tunes that sold well Most audiences until the mid s still heard their favorite artists playing live music on stage or via the radio And since radio shows were for the most part aimed at local audiences it was still rare for an artist in one area to reach a mass audience Also radio stations tended to cater to broad audience markets so an artist in one vein might not get broadcast on other stations geared to a set audience So popular versions of jazz country and western or rhythm and blues tunes and vice versa were frequent Consider Mack the Knife Die Moritat vom Mackie Messer this was originally from Bertolt Brecht s Die Dreigroschenoper It was popularized by a Hit Parade instrumental tune Moritat for the Dick Hyman Trio also recorded by Richard Hayman Jan August but a hit also for Louis Armstrong Bobby Darin and Ella Fitzgerald as vocal versions of Mack the Knife br Europe s Radio Luxembourg like many commercial stations also sold air time so record companies and others bought air time to promote their own artists or products thus increasing the number of recorded versions of any tune then available Add to this the fact that many radio stations were limited in their permitted needle time the amount of recorded music they were allowed to play or were regulated on the amount of local talent they had to promote in live broadcasts as with most national stations like the BBC in the UK br br In the US unlike most countries broadcasters pay royalties to authors and publishers Artists are not paid royalties so there is an incentive to record numerous versions of a song particularly in different genres For example King Records frequently cut both rhythm and blues and country and western versions of novelty songs like Good Morning Judge and Don t Roll those Bloodshot Eyes at Me This tradition was expanded when rhythm and blues songs began appearing on pop music charts br In the early days of rock and roll many tunes originally recorded by R B and country musicians were still being re recorded in a more popular vein by other artists with a more toned down style or professional polish This was inevitable because radio stations were reluctant to play formats outside their target audience s taste By far the most popular style of music in the mid s mid s was still the professional light orchestra therefore popular recording artists sought that format br For many purists these popular versions lacked the raw earthiness of the original introducing artists br Most did not have the kudos that rebellious teenagers craved the street credibility of rock and roll music most were performed and some were written by black artists not heard in popular mass entertainment markets Most parents considered the bowdlerized popular cover versions more palatable for the mass audience of parents and their children Artists targeting the white majority family audience were more acceptable to programmers at most radio and TV stations Singer songwriter Don McLean called the cover version a racist tool Many parents in the s s whether intentionally racist or not felt deeply threatened by the rapid pace of social change They had for the most part shared entertainment with their parents in ways their children had become reluctant to do The jukebox and the personal record disc player were still relatively expensive pieces of machinery and the portable radio a great novelty allowing truculent teenagers to shut themselves off br Tunes by introducing or original niche market artists that became successful on the mass audience Hit Parade charts are called crossovers as they crossed over from the targeted country jazz or rhythm audience Also many songs originally recorded by male artists were rerecorded by female artists and vice versa Such a cover version is also sometimes called a cross cover version male cover or female cover Incidentally until the mid s male vocalists often sang the female lyrics to popular songs though this faded rapidly after it was deemed decadent in Nazi Germany Some songs such as If Only for One Night were originally recorded by female artists but covered by mostly male artists br Reworking non English language tunes and lyrics for the Anglo Saxon markets was once a popular part of the music business For example the worldwide hit The Happy Wanderer was originally Der fr hliche Wanderer to this must be added Hymne a l amour Mutterlein Volare Seeman Quando Quando Quando L amour est bleu etc br br Cover versions of many popular songs have been recorded sometimes with a radically different style sometimes virtually unrecognizable from the original For example Sir Mix a Lot s rap Baby Got Back was covered by indie rock singer Jonathan Coulton in in an acoustic soft rock style Coulton s cover was then covered without attribution in by the show Glee and was so similar that Coulton among others alleged plagiarism of his arrangement and melody Some producers or recording artists may also enlist the services of a sample replay company such as Titan Tribute Media or Scorccio in order to replicate an original recording with precision detail and accuracy br A song may be covered into another language For example in the s a recording of Isle of Capri in Spanish by Osvaldo Fresedo and singer Roberto Ray is known Falco s German language hit Der Kommissar was covered in English by After the Fire although the German title was retained The English version which was not a direct translation of Falco s original but retained much of its spirit reached the Top on the US charts The Lion Sleeps Tonight evolved over several decades and versions from a Solomon Linda a cappella song Many of singer Laura Branigan s s hits were English language covers of songs already successful in Europe for the American record market Numerable English language covers exist of Luftballons by German singer Nena notably one by punk band Goldfinger one having been recorded by Nena herself following the success of her original German version Popcorn a song that was originally completely instrumental has had lyrics added in at least six different languages in various covers During the heyday of Cantopop in Hong Kong in the late s to early s many hits were covers of English and Japanese titles that have gained international fame but with localized lyrics sometimes multiple sets of lyrics sung to the same tune and critics often chide the music industry of shorting the tune composing process br Although modern cover versions are often produced for artistic reasons some aspects of the disingenuous spirit of early cover versions remain In the album buying heyday of the s albums of sound alike covers were created commonly released to fill bargain bins in the music section of supermarkets and even specialized music stores where uninformed customers might easily confuse them with original recordings The packaging of such discs was often intentionally confusing combining the name of the original artist in large letters with a tiny disclaimer like as originally sung by or as made popular by More recently albums such as the Kidz Bop series of compact discs featuring versions of contemporary songs sung by children have sold successfully br In the American musical comedy drama television series Glee debuted featuring several musical performances per episode The series featured solely cover songs performed by the series titular glee club until near the end of its second season with the episode Original Song The series still primarily uses cover songs of both chart hits and show tunes occasionally as mashups or distinct variations The show s musical performances have been a commercial success with over twenty one million copies of Glee cast single releases purchased digitally and over nine million albums purchased worldwide br Australian alternative indie radio station Triple J presents a weekly segment called Like a Version in which a band or musician performs one of their own songs as well as a song they love by another artist Originating in the popularity of the performances have resulted in the release of annual compilation albums of selected covers and more recently votes in the annual Triple J Hottest poll which has even sparked its own controversy br Conjoined cover songs are collectively referred to as a cover medley br On occasion a cover can become more popular than the original for instance Jimi Hendrix s version of Bob Dylan s All Along the Watchtower became the standard and Dylan even adjusted his performance style closer to the Hendrix version Johnny Cash s cover of Hurt by Nine Inch Nails is another example of the cover version eclipsing the original Besides these Elvis Presley s version of Carl Perkins original Blue Suede Shoes Santana s version of Peter Green s and Fleetwood Mac s Black Magic Woman Jeff Buckley s version of Leonard Cohen s Hallelujah Michael Jackson s version of Yellow Magic Orchestra s Behind the Mask Whitney Houston s versions of Dolly Parton s I Will Always Love You and of George Benson s The Greatest Love of All Nirvana s version of David Bowie s The Man Who Sold The World Gary Jules s version of Tears for Fears s Mad World Glenn Medeiros s version of George Benson s Nothing s Gonna Change My Love for You Lenny Kravitz s version of The Guess Who s American Woman Soft Cell s version of Gloria Jones s Tainted Love They Might Be Giants version of Istanbul Not Constantinople by The Four Lads Darius Rucker s version of Old Crow Medicine Show s Wagon Wheel and Sin ad O Connor s version of Nothing Compares U by Prince are songs where the cover was more successful than the original br With advancements in artificial intelligence internet users can create covers using RVC models br br Cover versions as the term is now used are often contemporary versions of familiar songs For example Singin in the Rain was originally introduced by Cliff Edwards in the film The Hollywood Revue of The famous Gene Kelly version was a revision that brought it up to date for a s Hollywood musical and was used in the film Singin in the Rain In it was covered by French singer Sheila accompanied by the B Devotion group as a disco song once more updating it to suit the musical taste of the era During the disco era there was a trend of taking well known songs and recording them in the disco style More recently Singin in the Rain has been covered and remixed by British act Mint Royale for a television commercial for Volkswagen Another example of this from a different angle is the tune Blueberry Hill many mistakenly believe the Fats Domino release to be the original recording and artist In fact it was originally introduced on film by Gene Autry and popularized on the record Hit Parade of by Glenn Miller The Fats Domino rock and roll version is the only one that might currently get widespread airplay on most media Similarly Unchained Melody was originally performed by Todd Duncan featured in the film Unchained based on the non fiction story Prisoners are People by Kenyon J Scudder Al Hibbler having the biggest number of worldwide record sales for the vocal version with Jimmy Young s cover version rival outdoing this in the UK Les Baxter s Orchestra gaining the big instrumentalist sales reaching the US Hit Parade number one spot in May but the Righteous Brothers later version top five on the US Hit Parade of September stalling at number in the UK in August is by far the wider known version and especially so following its appearance in the film Ghost House of the Rising Sun has hundreds of versions and in many genres such as folk blues rock and punk as well as dance and dubstep br Director Baz Luhrmann has contemporized and stylized older songs for use in his films New or cover versions such as John Paul Young s Love Is in the Air occur in Strictly Ballroom Candi Staton s Young Hearts Run Free appear in Romeo Juliet and adaptations of artists such as Nat King Cole Nirvana Kiss Elton John Thelma Houston Marilyn Monroe Madonna T Rex David Bowie Queen and the Police are used in Moulin Rouge The covers are carefully designed to fit into the structure of each film and suit the taste of the intended audience br Other artists release new versions of their own songs like German singer Nena who recorded an entire album with great success with new versions of older hits Cover songs can be used to display creativity of a performers work through the talent of another artist s previous production Not to be confused with a remix which is defined as altering or distorting the original sound electronically cover versions give a performer the ability to adapt music to their own style typically allowing them to change the genre of a song and recreating it to their own taste For example in Fall Out Boy covered Michael Jackson s hit song Beat It changing the genre from pop rock to a more punk rock feel Another example is when My Chemical Romance covered the Bob Dylan track Desolation Row This is more common with today s covers taking older popular music and revamping it to compare with modern popular music Aretha Franklin s cover of Otis Redding s Respect was voted the greatest cover song of all time according to Forbes com
