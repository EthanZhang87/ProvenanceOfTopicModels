Oklahoma is the first musical written by the duo of Rodgers and Hammerstein The musical is based on Lynn Riggs s play Green Grow the Lilacs Set in farm country outside the town of Claremore Indian Territory in it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc e Ado Annie br The original Broadway production opened on March It was a box office hit and ran for an unprecedented performances later enjoying award winning revivals national tours foreign productions and an Oscar winning film adaptation It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions Rodgers and Hammerstein won a special Pulitzer Prize for Oklahoma in br This musical building on the innovations of the earlier Show Boat epitomized the development of the book musical a musical play in which the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well made story with serious dramatic goals that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than amusement In addition Oklahoma features musical themes or motifs that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story A fifteen minute dream ballet reflects Laurey s struggle with her feelings about two men Curly and Jud br br br Background br By the early s Rodgers and Hammerstein were each well known for creating Broadway hits with other collaborators Rodgers with Lorenz Hart had produced over two dozen musicals since the s including such popular successes as Babes in Arms The Boys from Syracuse and Pal Joey Among other successes Hammerstein had written the words for Rose Marie The Desert Song The New Moon and Show Boat Though less productive in the s he wrote musicals songs and films sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern The Last Time I Saw Paris which was included in the film Lady Be Good By the early s Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil and he became unreliable prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him br br br Conception br In the Theatre Guild produced Lynn Riggs s Green Grow the Lilacs a play about settlers in Oklahoma Indian Territory Though the play was not successful ten years later in Theresa Helburn one of the Guild s producers saw a summer stock production supplemented with traditional folk songs and square dances and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild She contacted Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart whose first successful collaboration The Garrick Gaieties had been produced by the Theatre Guild in Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart Rodgers had asked Oscar Hammerstein II to collaborate with him and Hart During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart s By Jupiter in Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work he would be willing to take his place Coincidentally in Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing Green Grow the Lilacs but when he had approached Jerome Kern about it the latter declined Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book and he eagerly took the opportunity Hart lost interest in the musical he preferred contemporary urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing and he found the farmers and cowhands in Green Grow the Lilacs corny and uninspiring Moreover spiraling downward consumed by his longstanding alcoholism Hart no longer felt like writing He embarked on a vacation to Mexico advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator br This partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music In Rodgers previous collaborations with Hart Rodgers had always written the music first since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics Hammerstein s previous collaborators included composers Rudolf Friml Herbert Stothart Vincent Youmans and Kern who all wrote music first for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material Green Grow the Lilacs not by musical comedy conventions Musicals of that era featured big production numbers novelty acts and show stopping specialty dances the libretti typically focused on humor with little dramatic development punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration br br br Casting and development br Between the world wars roles in musicals were usually filled by actors who could sing but Rodgers and Hammerstein chose conversely to cast singers who could act Though Theresa Helburn codirector of the Theatre Guild suggested Shirley Temple as Laurey and Groucho Marx as Ali Hakim Rodgers and Hammerstein with director Rouben Mamoulian s support insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast As a result there were no stars in the production another unusual step The production was choreographed by Agnes de Mille her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway who provided one of the show s most notable and enduring features a minute first act ballet finale often referred to as the dream ballet depicting Laurey s struggle to evaluate her suitors Jud and Curly br The first title given to the work was Away We Go which opened for out of town tryouts in New Haven s Shubert Theatre on March Expectations for the show were low Hammerstein had written six flops in a row and the show had no star power Producer Mike Todd walked out after the first act during the tryout and wisecracked No girls no gags no chance But Rodgers and Hammerstein were confident The New Haven and Boston audiences were enthusiastic although the reviews were only fair Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway two would prove significant the dramatic restaging of the show stopping musical number Oklahoma and the decision to retitle the musical after that number br Todd had been wrong the show opened on Broadway to raves from the critics sold out and won a special Pulitzer Prize Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that the show s opening number Oh What a Beautiful Mornin changed the history of musical theater After a verse like that sung to a buoyant melody the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable The New York Post was the only major paper to give Oklahoma a mixed review Its critic felt that while the songs were pleasant enough they sounded much alike The show s creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein s contemporaries and ushered in the Golden Age of American musical theatre br br br Plot br br br Act I br In Oklahoma Territory in cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to a beautiful day as he visits farm girl Laurey Williams s yard Oh What a Beautiful Mornin He and Laurey tease each other while her Aunt Eller looks on There will be a box social dance that night which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse Each man who wins a basket will eat

best which is usually when it s dancing this resurrection of Rodgers and Hammerstein s epochal show is dewy with an adolescent lustiness both carnal and naive exuberant and confused The review stated that Anthony Ward s harmoniously curved set in which the sky seems to stretch into eternity again pulses with the promise of a land on the verge of transformation The New York Daily News review commented that Visually this one is stunning at times Anthony Ward s sets have a pastoral idyllic quality like Thomas Hart Benton s paintings At other times especially in lighting designer David Hersey s lustrous palette they convey the bleakness of the frontier The review also stated that the Royal National Theatre brought it back to us in a way that makes it seem fresh and vital However USA Today gave the production a tepid assessment its reviewer writing A cold breeze blows through this beautiful mornin and that golden haze is never quite bright enough The production went on to tour

at intermission The production s most important tonal change involved the character of Jud Fry Instead of the sinister brooding and threatening Jud of the original production in the revival he is depicted in a positive sympathetic light and his death came not as an accident but as an intended act at the hands of Curly followed by a sham trial to clear Curly of the blame br The production began

Tony br For the national tour Fish rethought the presentation which remained expressionistic but substituted a proscenium back drop which renders the original authorial intents far more in balance with the radical ideas of the production allowing the cast to play their parts with a contemporary naturalism according to Chicago Tribune critic Chris Jones The cast included Sasha Hutchings as Laurey Sean Grandillo as Curly and Barbara Walsh as Aunt Eller br In May the production reopened at the Young Vic in London for a seven week limited run starring Arthur Darvill as Curly and Anoushka

floor like drops of blood and a nightmarish dream dance sequence has Freudian overtones as Laurey s bridal gown becomes her shroud It received mixed reviews The Times reviewer wrote This is a very stylised overdrilled production no friend of intimate moments or quiet depth of emotion The Guardian liked it the most stating that it s a delight with one brilliant tippy tappy toed song after another and a nugget of darkness lodged in its sweet heart Whats On Stage like most of the papers gave the show three out of five stars and wrote that this is a downbeat vision and that all told it s a somewhat disappointing show but their average reader rating was four stars A review in The Telegraph commented Doyle uses shadow and silhouette to bring out the musical s nightmarish aspects but doesn t over labour them There are enough sunny spots no more so than in Act s rousing title song to keep the tone evenly textured br br br UK tour br The show toured England for nine months in in a

production directed by Peter Rothstein included African American dancers and an African American actor as Jud The choice was intended as in the Arena Stage production to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory but it has some audience members squirming in their seats they re seeing on stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history an imposing black man ravaging a petite white woman and the white hero all but urges Jud to hang himself and even pantomimes the act Some see a clear reference to lynching The Dream Ballet had a sinister sexual tone and ended with Jud dragging Laurey away to be raped One critic noted the historical license taken when an African American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance Maybe some people left with not so much a song in their head but a question in their heart And isn t that part of what theater is supposed to do Another wrote Rothstein s Oklahoma is now the story of a crazy sex obsessed black man lusting violently after his white mistress who ends up murdered at the hands of a white man who gets off scot free after a mock trial br br br UK tour br A UK tour ran from February to August directed by Rachel Kavanaugh and starring Ashley Day as Curly Charlotte Wakefield as Laurey Belinda Lang as Aunt Eller and Gary Wilmot as Ali Hakim br br br film adaptation br br The film adaptation starred Gordon MacRae Shirley Jones in her film debut Rod Steiger Charlotte Greenwood Gloria Grahame Gene Nelson James Whitmore and Eddie Albert It was the only musical film directed by Fred Zinnemann and Agnes de Mille choreographed It was the first feature film photographed in the Todd AO mm widescreen process br Rodgers and Hammerstein personally oversaw the film to prevent the studio from making the changes that were then typical of stage to film musical adaptations such as interpolating new songs by others The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage to film adaptation although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes changing the locations of several of the songs For example Kansas City is performed at the train station where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City Lyrics in the song about a burlesque stripteaser were slightly changed to pass film censorship In a nod to Green Grow the Lilacs which was the basis of the musical Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on before Curly jumps down landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife The film omits only It s a Scandal It s a Outrage and Lonely Room The film won Academy Awards for Best Music Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound Recording br br br Recordings br Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra both recorded versions of People Will Say We re In Love and Oh What a Beautiful Mornin in Due to the musicians strike however these recordings featured no instrumental accompaniment and instead were lugubriously weighed down by a cappella backup Producers of Oklahoma lamented the lack of high quality official recordings with Theresa Helburn writing to a colleague in August There are no records of Oklahoma that we can send you As you know the Petrillo ban on the union musicians still holds They cannot play for broadcasting so the only record that has been made is a singing of People Will Say We re in Love with Frank Sinatra which if it sounds anything like his radio singing of the same must be terrible Decca Records president Jack Kapp settled with the union in September and three weeks later he hastily booked the original cast and orchestra of Oklahoma into a recording studio br At a time when Broadway numbers were typically recorded by popular singers with smaller bands it was unique for Oklahoma to record its original cast with full orchestration Although some tunes were not included due to time and cost constraints most of the songs from Oklahoma were released on a record album by Decca Records in containing six inch double sided discs in RPM format It sold more than one million copies prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set These were issued as Oklahoma Volume Two In Decca re released the first set on LP but not the second set which soon became a very rare collectors item All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete Finally in Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD utilizing the original album artwork br The success of the original Oklahoma cast album set a precedent for the production of original cast recordings of Broadway musicals which became an essential part of a musical s dissemination and endurance in popular culture Later cast recordings of Oklahoma include the Broadway cast recording the London cast recording the Royal National Theatre cast recording the Broadway cast recording and a soundtrack album of the film There have also been more than studio cast recordings of the show featuring stars such as Nelson Eddy John Raitt and Florence Henderson in the leading roles br br br Reception br The original production of Oklahoma was an unprecedented critical and popular success John Anderson of the New York Journal American pronounced the musical a beautiful and delightful show fresh and imaginative as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers s music is to the ear It has at a rough estimate practically everything In the New York Herald Tribune Howard Barnes wrote Songs dances and a story have been triumphantly blended The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best and that is saying plenty Oscar Hammerstein nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship Louis Kronenberger of PM opined that Mr Hammerstein s lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart s at their best but the songs in Oklahoma call for less sophisticated words and Mr Hammerstein has found very likeable ones br In the New York Daily News Burns Mantle declared that Oklahoma really is different beautifully different With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein nd Oklahoma seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber s Show Boat New York World Telegram critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography stating that Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had Next to Mr Rodgers however must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille whose choreography carried out to perfection by her ballet corps is actually the biggest hit of the show The Out of My Dreams and All Er Nuthin dances are such supreme aesthetic delights They are spinetingling out of this world In The New York Sun Ward Morehouse commented that Oklahoma is charming and leisurely And tunely And certainly not topical as other shows had been in the early years of World War II It reveals Mr Rodgers shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart in good form indeed And nobody in last night s audience seemed to have a better time than Mr Hart himself who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B Lorenz Hart himself pushed his way through the crowd at the after show party in Sardi s restaurant and threw his arms around his ex partner grinning from ear to ear He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life br The only negative review of the musical appeared in the New York Post The critic wrote that it all seemed just a trifle too cute stating that the score consisted of a flock of Mr Rodgers s songs that are pleasant enough but still manage to sound quite a bit alike without much variety in the presentation She concluded that the show was very picturesque in a studied fashion reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome br br br Antecedents and influence br According to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak Not only is Oklahoma the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song character plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades William Zinsser observed that Oklahoma broke the old musical comedy conventions with the songs delving into character and advancing the plot The show became a milestone so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to Oklahoma Oklahoma made Rodgers and Hammerstein the most important contributors to the musical play form The examples they set in creating vital plays often rich with social thought provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own br Theater historian Ethan Mordden points out that although Oklahoma has been called the first integrated musical the first American folk musical Show Boat got there first on both counts Even earlier the Princess Theatre musicals following Gilbert and Sullivan and French op ra bouffe began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals paving the way for Show Boat and Oklahoma by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs These Princess Theatre shows which featured modern American settings built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved The characters and situations were within the limitations of musical comedy license believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters Kern s exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization Mordden also notes that Oklahoma was called the first great dance musical but other musicals had earlier focused on dance among them Gay Divorce and On Your Toes He concludes But Oklahoma was the first American musical with an ethnic sound words and music entirely in the folk idiom br Critic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected its author s and composer s Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish Americans Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish Americans and Jud embodying Jewish Americans fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans br br br Awards and nominations br br br Original Broadway production br br br
