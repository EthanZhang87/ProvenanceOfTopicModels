a revised list Elvis Presley was also one of three Presley albums to receive accolades in the reference book Albums You Must Hear Before You Die It was certified gold on November and platinum on August by the Recording Industry Association of America br The original UK release called Rock n Roll on HMV Catalog Number CLP has five different tracks br br br Background br By the second half of singles on Sun Records by Presley began making the national country and western singles chart Baby Let s Play House and I Forgot to Remember to Forget going to number and number respectively Colonel Tom Parker the new manager of Presley had extensive dealings with RCA Victor through his previous client singer Eddy Arnold especially with the head of the Country and Western and Rhythm and blues division Steve Sholes At the urging of Parker on November Sholes bought Presley s contract from Sam Phillips the head of Sun Records and Studio for the unprecedented sum of Presley and rock and roll were still untested properties for the major labels in the music business but this album along with the number one single Heartbreak Hotel proved the selling power of both it was the first RCA Victor pop album to earn more than and in it had sold over one million units br br br Content br br Presley made appearances in four consecutive weeks on the Dorsey Brothers television program Stage Show in early on January February February and February RCA wanted an album in the stores fast to capitalize both on the nationwide TV exposure and the success of his first hit single on the pop charts with Heartbreak Hotel swiftly climbing to the top after its release on January At the same time there had only been two series of Presley recording sessions for RCA Victor by the end of the Dorsey stint after which Presley and his band were back on the road Those two sessions yielded an additional eleven tracks almost enough to fill an entire LP although some tracks had singles potential In the s general practice dictated tracks having greater commercial potential to be released as singles with tracks of lesser appeal placed on albums as such RCA Victor neither took all eleven tracks and simply made an album nor placed the already released and briskly selling Heartbreak Hotel on it The rights to the Sun Studio tapes had transferred to RCA Victor with the sale of his contract so five previously unreleased Sun songs I Love You Because Just Because Tryin to Get to You I ll Never Let You Go Little Darlin and Blue Moon were added to seven of the RCA Victor sessions tracks to bring the running time of the album up to an acceptable length Phillips produced the sessions at Sun and no producer was officially listed for the RCA Victor sessions leading to the belief that Presley himself produced them br As the Sun tracks were mostly country styled Elvis and RCA Victor leavened the selections with covers of recent rhythm and blues songs Two of these Money Honey by Jesse Stone known to Elvis from a version by Clyde McPhatter and Ray Charles hit I Got a Woman had been in Presley s live act for a year A third was the frenetic announcement to the world of the existence of Little Richard in Tutti Frutti A rockabilly number that was believed to be a potential hit and could hold its own with the R B material Blue Suede Shoes was not initially released as a single from a promise by Sholes to Sam Phillips to protect the career of another Sun artist Carl Perkins the author of the song Instead it was diverted into being the opening track on the album br On August RCA Victor took the unusual step of releasing the entire album as singles which undoubtedly kept the new single released simultaneously Shake Rattle and Roll backed with Lawdy Miss Clawdy from reaching the charts However Blue Suede Shoes released in single form as a part of this experiment by RCA Victor kept the promise to Phillips and Perkins by waiting over eight months since the song s release on Sun It had however been the lead song on two earlier EPs which sold well enough to make it to number on the singles chart the week of April br br br Artwork br The cover is ranked number on Rolling Stone s list of the greatest album covers published in The photograph of Elvis was taken at the Fort Homer Hesterly Armory in Tampa Florida on July Initially it was thought that Popsie Randolph took the image featured on the front cover since the album only credited one photographer However in August Joseph A Tunzi documented that the actual photographer was William V Red Robertson of Robertson Fresch The Popsie credit attributed to the album only applied to a series of photos featured on the back cover taken in New York City in early December shortly after Presley had signed with RCA Victor Tunzi was quoted in the Tampa Tribune as saying Forget about Popsie Popsie did not take that photo br The graphic and photo were also used on an EP and a double EP comprising songs from this album also released in March br The design was echoed by the Clash for the front of their album London Calling that cover is number on the Rolling Stone list of greatest album covers noted previously Other acts of cover homage include F Punk by Big Audio Dynamite in and Reintarnation in by k d lang and Chumbawamba s controversial single Tony Blair br br br Reissues br RCA first reissued the original track album on compact disc in This issue in reprocessed fake stereo sound was quickly withdrawn and the disc was reissued in original mono In RCA reissued the album with an altered running order adding on six bonus
