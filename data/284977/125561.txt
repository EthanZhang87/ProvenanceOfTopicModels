A rock and roll standard Heartbreak Hotel has been covered by several rock and pop acts including Willie Nelson and Leon Russell who recorded a duet version that topped the Country charts in br RCA reissued Heartbreak Hotel on CD in on its th anniversary featuring the black and white EP cover br br The song was written in by Mae Boren Axton a high school teacher with a background in musical promotion and Jacksonville Florida based singer songwriter Tommy Durden The lyrics were based on a report supposedly in The Miami Herald about a man who had destroyed all his identity papers and jumped to his death from a hotel window leaving a suicide note with the single line I walk a lonely street Songfacts com says they were unable to locate the Miami Herald story They labeled it an urban legend In an article in Rolling Stone magazine suggested that the story in reality originated from a report about a painter and criminal Alvin Krolik whose marriage had failed and who wrote a unpublished autobiography including the line This is the story of a person who walked a lonely street Krolik s story was published in news media and received further publicity after he was shot and killed in an attempted robbery in El Paso Texas On August the El Paso Times reported Krolik s death under the headline Story Of Person Who Walked Lonely Street Krolik s death is not a suicide so he can have inspired the song to Tommy Durden br Axton and Durden give different accounts of how the song was written Durden s account is that he had already written the song and performed it with his band the Swing Billys before he presented it to Axton Axton s account is that Durden had written only a few lines of the song and asked her to help him finish it She says that the report of the suicide stunned her and she told Durden Everybody in the world has someone who cares Let s put a Heartbreak Hotel at the end of this lonely street They were interrupted by the arrival of Glenn Reeves a local performer who had previously worked with Axton The duo asked Reeves to help with the song but after hearing the title he remarked that it was the silliest thing I ve ever heard and left them to finish it themselves The song was written within an hour and Durden recorded it onto Axton s tape recorder Reeves returned and after hearing the song he was asked to provide a voice demo for Axton in the style of Elvis Presley Reeves obliged but once again turned down the offer of a writing credit for his input br Axton approached the popular singing duo the Wilburn Brothers and offered them the chance to record Heartbreak Hotel However Doyle and Teddy Wilburn declined describing the song as strange and almost morbid Axton however agreed to a publishing deal with Buddy Killen a young Nashville bass player who had recently set up his own publishing company called Tree Publishing With a publishing deal in place Axton arranged through Presley s manager Colonel Tom Parker to present the song to Presley at the annual Country Music Disc Jockey Convention in Nashville Tennessee where he was to be named the most promising male country star of Axton had been hired earlier in the year to publicise the Hank Snow Jamboree concerts at the Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville Florida which included Presley in the line up During one concert Axton observed the reaction of the audience to Presley s performance in which a crowd of screaming fans chased him back to his dressing room and ripped his clothes off to take as souvenirs Axton followed Presley s career closely after this incident and met him at a July concert in Jacksonville this time interviewing him for the local media According to author Albert Goldman Axton made writing Presley s first big hit one of her ambitions br Rumors had been circulating in the press for several weeks that Presley who had begun his career at Sun Records was ready to move to RCA Victor to help launch him nationally Axton played the demo to him in his room at the Andrew Jackson Hotel on November Upon hearing the demo Presley exclaimed Hot dog Mae play that again and listened to it ten times memorizing the song After signing with RCA on November Presley accepted Axton s offer of a third of the royalties if he made the song his first single on his new label Presley performed the song for the first time in Swifton Arkansas on December and declared to the audience that it would be his first hit br br Heartbreak Hotel was the second song Presley recorded at RCA Victor following I Got a Woman during his debut session at McGavock Street in Nashville on January Presley arrived at the studio with the song ready to record without seeking RCA s approval and although producer Steve Sholes was not sure that it would be a success he recorded Heartbreak Hotel believing that Presley knew what he was doing Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented It was a larger studio than Sun s and more regimented they called everything by a tape number We would sit around at Sun eat hamburgers and then somebody would say Let s try something br Almost immediately Sholes discovered a problem while recording Presley RCA Victor had always insisted their performers stay still as they sang so the microphone would pick up the vocals even the slightest tilt of the head would result in missing sound Sholes had told Presley to stand on a painted X on the floor telling him Whatever you do don t move During the recording of I Got a Woman Sholes noticed that Presley s voice and guitar were not always being picked up by the microphone Presley explained to Sholes that he had to jump around to sing it right It s something that just happens just a part of the way I sing Sholes arranged for the whole studio to be re miked so that Presley s voice and guitar could be picked up from anywhere in the studio and recording continued br br As well as the Blue Moon Boys his regular backing band of Moore the bassist Bill Black and the drummer D J Fontana Presley was joined by two established RCA Victor musicians Chet Atkins who also helped Sholes produce the session on guitar and Floyd Cramer on piano Following a suggestion from Presley Sholes used a hallway at the studio to get an unusual echo for the single Sholes was attempting to recapture the Sun Records sound but he was unaware that Sun founder Sam Phillips had used two tape recorders and a slight time delay to create it on previous Presley recordings When Phillips first heard Heartbreak Hotel he remarked that it was a morbid mess Most others at RCA agreed declaring Heartbreak Hotel a terrible choice of song especially after hearing that the finished recording sounded nothing like Presley s Sun recordings Internal memos from the time show that every one of RCA s executive corps disliked it so much that one of them insisted We certainly can t release that one br In an interview Durden conceded that he did not recognize his song after Presley had made the changes to it in the studio including the tempo phrasing lyrics and overall sound In subsequent recordings these major modifications to the existing material became a normal procedure for Presley who took over the role of producer although Sholes was still credited Phillips said Sholes was not a producer Steve was just at every session br br Heartbreak Hotel was released as a single on January with B side I Was the One a song that was also recorded during Presley s RCA Victor debut sessions Billboard magazine praised it as a strong blues item wrapped up in his usual powerful style and a great beat However Heartbreak Hotel was less than warmly received by the British music press The New Musical Express wrote that If you appreciate good singing I don t suppose you ll manage to hear this disc all through BBC which held a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain at the time didn t consider it fit for general entertainment and placed it on its restricted play list br Presley made his national television debut on January appearing on CBS Stage Show starring Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey As Stage Show s ratings had been slipping producer Jack Philbin agreed to have Presley on because he was relatively cheap at about in after looking at a photograph of the singer Philbin exclaimed He s a guitar playing Marlon Brando Despite the single having been released only a day before to coincide with Presley s national television debut the Dorsey brothers did not allow Presley to perform it on their show because it didn t work well in rehearsals For his second appearance on February Presley was again aware that he could not perform Heartbreak Hotel However at his third appearance on Stage Show a week later Sholes pressured CBS to give consent Subsequently Presley and his band performed Heartbreak Hotel with borrowed instruments their own were being driven to Florida in preparation for a tour with the backing of the Dorsey Brothers orchestra br On February the song entered the Billboard pop chart at number and the Country and Western chart at number nine Within two months Heartbreak Hotel reached number one on both charts It also made top five on the R B chart the first Presley single to chart there This resulted in Heartbreak

said It was just the experience of hearing it and having my hair stand on end We d never heard American voices singing like that They always sang like Sinatra or enunciate very well Suddenly there s this hillbilly hiccuping on tape echo and all this bluesy stuff going on And we didn t know what Elvis was singing about It took us a long time to work what was going on To us it just sounded as a

autobiography that Heartbreak Hotel had a huge effect on him Beyond Presley s singing itself it was the total effect of his sound and his silence that so totally affected Richards br br Then Since my baby left me it was just the sound That was the first rock and roll I heard It was a totally different way of delivering a song a totally different sound stripped down no bullshit no violins and ladies choruses and schmaltz totally different It was bare right to the roots that you had a feeling were there but hadn t yet heard I ve got to take my hat off to Elvis The silence is your canvas

Heartbreak Hotel which catapulted Presley s regional popularity into national hysteria opened a fissure in the massive mile thick wall of post war regimentation standardization bureaucratization and commercialization in American society and let come rushing through the rift a cataract from the immense waters of sheer human pain and frustration that have been building up for ten decades behind it
