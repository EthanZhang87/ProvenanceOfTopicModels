principle the HKPF is officially independent of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Security of the People s Republic of China which under usual circumstances may not interfere with Hong Kong s local law enforcement matters All HKPF officers are employed as civil servants and therefore required to pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Basic Law br The HKPF consists of approximately officers including the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force civil servants and its Marine Region officers and vessels as of br br br History br br A police force has been serving Hong Kong since shortly after the island was established as a colony in On April weeks after the British landed in Hong Kong Captain Charles Elliot established a policing authority in the new colony empowering Captain William Caine to enforce Qing law in respect of local inhabitants and British Police Law for non natives By October an organised police force still under the direction of Caine who was also Chief Magistrate was routinely bringing criminals before the courts for trial Caine s role as head of the police force ended when its first Superintendent was appointed on February Captain Haly of the st Madras Native Infantry The formal establishment of the force was gazetted on May br During World War II Japan occupied Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Police Force was temporarily disbanded br The s saw the commencement of Hong Kong s year rise to global prominence during which time the Hong Kong Police tackled many issues that have challenged Hong Kong s stability Between and Hong Kong experienced several huge waves of immigration from mainland China most notably In the s and s large numbers of Vietnamese boat people arrived in Hong Kong posing challenges first for marine police secondly for officers who manned the dozens of camps in the territory and lastly for those who had to repatriate them The force was granted the use of the title royal in for its handling of the Hong Kong riots renaming it the Royal Hong Kong Police Force br In the Independent Commission Against Corruption ICAC was created to give government wide ranging powers to investigate corruption At the turn of the s the Hong Kong Police Force began marketing itself as Asia s Finest br The recruitment of Europeans to the force ceased in and in the Royal Hong Kong Police took responsibility for patrolling the

raising on each anniversary With the handover of sovereignty the police force dropped the prefix Royal from its name br In the s the police force played a prominent role in relation to the Hong Kong protests and Hong Kong protests Following Chris Tang s appointment as the Commissioner of Police in November the police force changed its motto from We serve with pride and care which had been used for more than years to Serving Hong Kong with honour duty and loyalty The Economist suggested that this change would curry favour with the central government of China In July as part of a process to remove colonial aspects from the force foot drills changed from British style to Chinese People s Liberation Army style with a goose step The language spoken during drills changed from English to Chinese and junior officers stopped addressing higher ranking officers with Yes Sir br br br Controversies br br During the s the HKPF faced a number of corruption scandals involving officers During the s and s the force struggled with corruption issues relating to bribes from syndicated drugs and illegal gambling operations Police corruption again emerged as a major concern in the early s when the Commissioner ordered investigations to break the culture of corruption causing forty odd officers to flee Hong Kong with more than HK million cash about HK million each br More recently the Hong Kong Police Force has faced extensive allegations of misconduct during the protests including excessive force brutality torture and falsified evidence In particular the police were criticised for their failure to respond during the mob attack at the Yuen Long MTR station in July Several lawsuits were filed in October against the HKPF for failure to show identification during protests br In May
