The Battle of Beverwijk Dutch Slag bij Beverwijk was a violent confrontation between two hooligan supporter groups of Dutch Association football clubs Ajax and Feyenoord the S C F Hooligans and the F Side The incident took place on March along the A motorway near Beverwijk from which its name is derived br br br Prelude br The intent of the meeting between the two groups was a revanche after the previously short and especially disappointing fight for the Ajax hooligans F Side which had previously taken place along the A motorway In the previous incident both groups were to arrive with hooligans each ready for combat The Feyenoord hooligans S C F however arrived with The F Side group were forced to escape since they had actually arrived with fighters as previously agreed upon between the two groups The S C F didn t hold their promise as other occasions showed that the F side group often did the same to other groups On the date of the event Ajax and Feyenoord were scheduled to play in Waalwijk and Alkmaar and the police were made aware that both supporter groups were going to clash on that date but they did not know at which location A platoon of police mobile units was deployed to the Beverwijkse Bazaar nonetheless to protect the crowd from a potential hazard br br br The confrontation br Due to road construction the two hooligan groups of both clubs each a few hundred men strong met in a meadow near the motorway armed with knives baseball bats iron bars electroshock weapons and claw hammers along with other armaments the groups went into combat in an unprecedented fashion The Feyenoord hooligans kept the upper hand trapped the Ajax hooligans along the motorway while attacking from both sides The remaining Ajax hooligans were forced to fight or run for their lives When the police arrived on the scene they were very surprised by the speed and intensity of the fighting The Police had arrived so late that no arrests were actually made but several weapons were seized from both parties involved br br br The death of Carlo Picornie and the aftermath br During the scuffle one of the Ajax hooligans Carlo Picornie was killed He was one of the more long term members within the hard core of the F Side He died due to knife stabs which filled his lungs One member of S C F was convicted due to Carlo Picornie s death namely year old Leonardo Pansier who was given an unconditional prison sentence of years During the procedure following the murder of Carlo Picornie Leonardo Pansier was also found guilty of attempted murder on H Joos another Ajax hooligan Joos was also present in the violent attack in Beverwijk and was seriously injured here as well Feyenoord hooligan Marco P and year old hooligan Dani l C were sentenced to four years in prison Dani l C was convicted because he stabbed H Joos with a knife and likely was involved in the death of Carlo Picornie Charged with attempted murder Marco P was also charged with the same sentence for his involvement in the murder of Carlo Picornie Feyenoord hooligan Vincent M was also convicted in the attack on H Joos having beaten him with a bat Although he claimed to have not hit hard with the bat he too was convicted of attempted murder as well as having raised suspicion regarding his involvement with the murder of Carlo Picornie Leonardo Pansier was the only participant to have continuously denied involvement in the murder of Picornie br In Leonardo Pansier was invited as a guest on the TV show Sophie op of BNN where he revealed that he felt betrayed by members of his own hooligan group The stories that made the rounds regarding several people who were involved in those incidents during the court process failed to include those who executed the final blow Claiming that those who actually killed him were never caught But the fact of the matter is that more Feyenoord hooligans made accusative recounts towards Leonardo Pansier in their statements which ultimately led to the conviction of Leonardo Pansier in the case Multiple witnesses at the scene had reported to have seen Leonardo enraged with a bicycle lock beating on Carlo s head Furthermore the videotape of the A motorway security cameras had captured the act on camera However the footage from the camera was deemed as insufficient because it was of poor quality and did not capture a lot of what had actually happened along the motorway br br br Alleged scheme br Carlo Picornie was born October and due to his age was no longer considered an active member of the hard core of the F Side But Picornie wanted to set an example for the young emerging hooligans at Ajax and attended the Battle in Beverwijk During the fight Picornie was separated from his group along with H Joos with both Ajax hooligans being surrounded by Feyenoord Hooligans leading to their injuries and Carlo s death on the scene br Following the funeral of Picornie in which Ajax chairman Michael van Praag was in attendance unrest began amongst the F Side hooligans The Ajax hooligans started to blame each other for Picornie s death claiming that not enough was done to protect his life It was also not being considered an accident that alone Picornie was targeted and coincidentally murdered Picornie had been an icon for Ajax hooligans for years an old member with a violent reputation amongst the F Side Prior to his death Picornie was known to never avoid a confrontation It was believed that the Feyenoord hooligans were looking to send a message to the Ajax hooligans group by murdering Picornie During the TV show De Harde Kern from with host Bas van Hout which focused on the hooligan groups of the biggest clubs of the Netherlands Bas van Hout interviewed two masked members of the Feyenoord hooligan group who offered some information over the events that occurred in Beverwijk According to one of these hooligans it could not just as easily been a different hooligan than Picornie That due to the circumstances Picornie had been singled out by the Feyenoord hooligans due to his reputation as an Ajax hooligan Given the manner in which he was killed probably at the hand of more than one person his murder was largely considered intentional and that the Feyenoord hooligans had singled out Picornie considering the reputation of the fighter to consciously send a message to the hooligans of Ajax But whether it was known from the Feyenoord group that Picornie would be in attendance or whether they had singled him out remains unknown It is also said that Picornie simply had bad luck to encounter a bunch of Feyenoord hooligans who were under the influence of drugs and alcohol who simply beat him to death br During the broadcast of De harde kern the Feyenoord hooligans had revealed to Bas van Hout that a certain hierarchy was present within the hooligan groups which was comparable to that of a criminal organization Those who stood accused by the Public prosecution were later wiped from the table by a Judge because there was no substantial evidence delivered Even though the meeting and intention had been declared as premeditated with an example of both hooligan groups being delivered due to their previous encounter along A It is also noteworthy that although the police were present during the incident that very little police intervention was done Weapons were simply confiscated and people were being searched for weapons to prove whether or not they were participants in the incident instead Nobody at the time of the event was held accountable or arrested It was said that the police were possibly scared that arrests would lead to more violence Later when more clarity regarding the incident had come to light it became clear that some arrests actually had been made A few days prior to the battle of Beverwijk Ajax hooligans had been called pussies by ex Feyenoord hooligan Dani l C As Dani l was being interviewed by a journalist of NOS after a short altercation along the A motorway Later Ajax hooligans were made the laughing stock on camera by Feyenoord hooligan Gijs van D through a banner in De Kuip which read A dam lopen altijd weg A mietjes English A dam always run away A pussies Events such as this one along with other incidents are also regarded as contributing factors in the battle of Beverwijk for which Carlo Picornie paid with his life br br br Aftermath br During the broadcast of the show Sophie op it became clear that the death of Picornie had caused great unrest in the S C F hooligans group of Feyenoord as well People reportedly told on each other resulting in several convictions Noninvasive statements had been made about each other with many people lying about their involvement regarding Picornies death The three Feyenoord hooligans who were guests on the show reported that those truly responsible for the death of Picornie could no longer live in Rotterdam and that they themselves had already left the city out of fear for revenge from fellow members The only person who was eventually convicted of the murder of Picornie stated in the broadcast that His life had changed to a peaceful one due to the events he had experienced in Beverwijk although he would remain a hooligan The definite responsible for Picornies death never became clear as Leonardo Pansier kept denying his involvement in the murder As a so called vow of silence exists amongst the hooligans group of people involved this may never become clear br The death of Picornie lead to a lot of anxiety in the media He had not been the first deadly victim of hooligan club violence In FC Twente hooligan Eric Lassche had been beaten to death during riots The novel de Movo Tapes by Dutch writer A F Th van der Heijden is partially based on the
