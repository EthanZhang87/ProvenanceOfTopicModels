Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones and was directed by Henry King br As with the original stage production the film contains some of Rodgers and Hammerstein s most famous songs and perhaps the most serious storyline of all of their musicals br br br Plot br Billy Bigelow a rough talking macho handsome carousel barker and Julie Jordan a young innocent mill worker live in the small town of Boothbay Harbor Maine They fall in love but are fired from their jobs Billy because he paid too much attention to Julie and incurred the wrath of the jealous carousel owner Mrs Mullin and Julie because she had violated the curfew imposed by wealthy mill owner Mr Bascombe br Billy and Julie marry and live at the seaside spa and restaurant of her cousin Nettie Jordan Julie admits that Billy frustrated and bitter because he cannot find work has started hitting her Mrs Mullin hears of this and wishes to rehire Billy but only if he leaves his wife However Julie informs him that she is pregnant Billy is overjoyed and declines Mrs Mullin s offer However worried about finances and lacking work experience Billy secretly agrees to join his pal Jigger Craigin in robbing Bascombe br During a clambake on a nearby island Billy and Jigger sneak onto the mainland to commit the robbery but Bascombe who is usually unarmed carries a gun and the robbery is foiled While Bascombe is momentarily distracted Jigger flees and leaves Billy at the mercy of the police Cornered Billy climbs atop a pile of crates but they collapse and Billy falls on his own knife The others return from the clambake and Julie sees the mortally wounded Billy She rushes to him and he dies after saying his last words to her Julie is devastated because she truly loved him even though she never had the courage to say so out loud br Fifteen years later in another world apparently Purgatory or the back door of Heaven Billy is told that he can return to Earth for one day to make amends Billy returns to find his daughter Louise emotionally scarred by constant taunting because her father tried to commit a robbery Without disclosing his identity to Louise Billy makes himself visible tries to raise her spirits and gives her a star that he stole from Heaven Louise is frightened and refuses the star but Billy in desperation slaps her hand She rushes inside the house and informs Julie of what happened saying that she did not feel a slap but a kiss Billy tries to become invisible before Julie can see him but she glimpses him for a brief moment and senses that he has returned for a reason Billy asks his heavenly guide for permission to attend Louise s high school graduation and there he silently gives Louise and Julie the confidence that they need and the knowledge that in spite of everything he did love Julie As he leaves the graduation ceremony he is taken back to heaven while the unseen chorus sang the last lines of the song br br br Cast br Gordon MacRae as Billy Bigelow br Shirley Jones

Christie as Mrs Mullin br Robert Rounseville as Enoch Snow br John Dehner as Mr Bascombe br Susan Luckey as Louise Bigelow br Jacques d Amboise as the Starlight Carnival barker br William LeMassena as the Heavenly Friend br Tor Johnson as Strong Man uncredited br Frank Sinatra was originally cast to play Billy Bigelow and recorded the songs that he was to sing in the film It had been reported that Sinatra withdrew in objection to the requirement that each scene be filmed twice one for regular CinemaScope and the other for CinemaScope but according to Shirley Jones autobiography he quit because his wife Ava Gardner threatened infidelity if he failed to accompany her on her film set Gardner was in the late stages of filming The Barefoot Contessa br br br Production br The film was shot in CinemaScope and DeLuxe Color However it was projected in regular mm CinemaScope rather than the mm version of the process although the original premiere did feature a six track magnetic stereo soundtrack specially devised for CinemaScope It was played on a separate machine synchronized with the picture All of the other prints of the film were composite prints and used the standard four track stereo soundtrack featured on regular CinemaScope films circa br Cinematographer Charles G Clarke explained that In the beginning it was decided to film Carousel in both mm and the standard mm CinemaScope This meant double setups for each shot When the results became available for screening our studio decided the mm version was no longer required and thereafter we filmed the production only in mm CinemaScope The new mm CinemaScope negative is exactly four diameters greater in size than mm twice the width and twice as high so that reductions are made without altering the composition of the original negative br Filming took place in the Maine locations of Boothbay Harbor Camden Newcastle and Augusta as well as Paradise Cove California and the th Century Fox studios br br br Differences from stage production br br The film follows the stage musical faithfully except for five major changes br br In the film Billy dies by accident when he falls on his own knife while trying to escape arrest In the original stage production he commits suicide by deliberately stabbing himself while standing on the pile of crates which does not collapse br The recitative singing in the bench scene leading directly into the song If I Loved You is instead spoken dialogue in the film br The recitative singing that leads directly into the song June Is Bustin Out All Over was eliminated br The film begins in with Billy having been dead for years and the story of his life on Earth from his first meeting with Julie at the carousel to his death is a flashback that consumes the majority of the film Billy tells his story to the Starkeeper to receive permission to return to Earth for one day which he had been offered when he first arrived but had declined This last change was enacted to prevent film audiences from being surprised at Billy s death and to prevent them believing that the film had ended at that point br In the film there is no specific mention that Billy must return to Earth for one day and perform a good deed in order to win entry into Heaven as in the play In the film s opening scene a pre credits sequence a heavenly friend advises Billy that there s trouble down on Earth should he wish to return there Billy does return but the film does not intimate that he is doing so in order to be admitted into Heaven br The song When the Children Are Asleep was moved to a later moment in order to take full advantage of the Maine locale br br br Reception br The New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote Carousel like Oklahoma before it is a beautifully turned out film crisply played and richly sung by a fine cast that is fully worthy of the original musical show And Twentieth Century Fox its producers not to be outdone by the producers of Oklahoma who made that one in the new large screen Todd AO have run out their latest large screen process CinemaScope which gives more clarity if not more size to the imnage for this production of Carousel The honor does something more than flatter the eminence of the enterprise It endows the production with a sharpness of line and color that is well nigh superb Seldom has a musical comedy been made to look more handsome on the screen And that as they say is something that couldn t happen to a nicer show T he picture follows the stage play most faithfully in plot and in mood Its pathos derives from human nature its poignance is wholly genuine You may look for two hours of fine enjoyment in this beautiful touching Carousel Sources differ as to the film s financial success Musical theater scholar Thomas Hischak stated that the film was a box office success across the country and th Century Fox earned a considerable profit on the picture However Allmovie states The film s often downbeat tone did not resonate with s audiences making Carousel a surprising box office flop Some reviewers were also critical of the acceptance of wife beating in the film br br br Soundtrack br br Two songs recorded for the film You re a Queer One Julie Jordan and Blow High Blow Low were removed in order to limit the film s duration but have been included in all editions of the soundtrack album The Highest Judge of All was eliminated from the film score and does not appear on the soundtrack album presumably because the flashback scenes precluded it Mr Snow s sentimental song Geraniums in the Winder which serves as an introduction to Stonecutters Cut It on Stone was also eliminated as was a reprise of Mister Snow As with The Highest Judge neither Geraniums in the Winder nor the reprise of Mister Snow was recorded for the film and neither has appeared on any editions of the film s soundtrack One verse of Stonecutters Cut It on Stone which appears on the album was omitted from the film perhaps because of objectionable content br The soundtrack album also features the complete version of Carousel Waltz which is first heard at the beginning of the original stage musical and early in the film Because of its length only an abridged version of the waltz is heard in the film and many stage productions of Carousel shorten the piece as well The soundtrack album version of the song When the Children Are Asleep includes the long introductory section to the song sung by Mr Snow as it is in the stage musical but the film does not include it The album also includes a section of If I Loved You that is not in the film br The album was first issued on vinyl LP in by Capitol Records but only in mono However because the film s soundtrack had been recorded in stereo as were all early CinemaScope films including stereo dialog Capitol released a stereo version of the album in The later release was shortened by approximately five minutes by abridging the opening instrumental Carousel Waltz because of technical limitations of stereo The mono release as originally issued played for about minutes while the stereo version played for minutes br A large team of orchestrators contributed to the complex musical arrangements including Nelson Riddle Herbert W Spencer Earle Hagen Edward B Powell Bernard Mayer and Gus Levene br Three editions of the soundtrack album were issued on compact disc all in stereo The first issued in by Capitol was an exact duplicate of the stereo release The rights then were obtained by Angel Records which issued a second edition of the album featuring the complete Carousel Waltz in stereo for the first time The release was superseded in by Angel s expanded edition which for the first time featured almost all of the songs and music recorded for the film including the dance music resulting in a playing time of minutes br Under the vocal direction of Ken Darby the songs on the expanded edition of the album are br br Introduction Gordon MacRae William
