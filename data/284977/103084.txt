her pages The comic was unique in that it featured appearances by characters from across the spectrum of comics publishers including Marvel and DC superheroes Beano Dandy Eagle and Viz characters Doctor Who the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in addition to a cavalcade of British comedy figures both real and fictional These were all linked by the twin framing narratives of the Comic Relief night

given in various supermarkets and charity shops such as Oxfam in exchange for a donation to the charity and to make others laugh People are encouraged to wear the noses on Red Nose Day to help raise awareness of the charity The design of the nose has been changed each year beginning with a fairly plain one which later grew arms turned into a tomato and even changed colour This regular re design was in part to stop people from re using previous years designs and having to buy the latest version as for example some people may re use the same Poppy repeatedly rather than buying a new one each year In the red nose was made of foam this was to facilitate the growing of the nose by rolling it in the user s hands to keep in line with that year s tagline The Big One see the table below Larger noses are also available and are designed to be attached to the fronts of cars buildings and in a metre foot diameter inflatable nose was attached to the DFDS Seaways cruiseferry King of Scandinavia

recorded at Hook Studios Hook Surrey by the Out of the Ark Choir which is completely made up of children The children in the video wear Stella McCartney s special edition Comic Relief T shirts and was filmed in black and white so that only the red stood out br br br Criticism br There has been some concern about the lack of gender equality in the causes supported by Comic Relief with much funding going to politicised women s charities or charities focusing on women Writing in The Spectator Ross Clark raised the question Why do all these women s charities feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the prat fest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public He added Are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous br The British Stammering Association criticised comedian Lenny Henry over his opening sketch for the telethon during which he spoofed the film The King s Speech and grew impatient with Colin Firth in his portrayal of King George VI as he stammered over his speech The Sun reported that the British Stammering Association had branded the sketch as a gross and disgusting gleefulness at pointing out someone else s misfortune br In December an edition of the BBC One series Panorama pointed out that between and millions of pounds donated to Comic Relief had been invested in funds which appeared to contradict several of its core aims with shares in tobacco alcohol and arms firms br The event was strongly criticised by viewers for various technical issues glitches and having two adult orientated skits shown before the pm watershed one where Vic Reeves showed a fake penis to Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid and another featuring a scene in which presenter Graham Norton asks model Cara Delevingne why she had sex on a plane The event was also criticised for two pre watershed instances of profanity one involving a Mrs Brown s Boys skit where the titular character does a V sign a gesture that is deemed profane in the United Kingdom and another involving Russell Brand after a technical blunder caused him to swear and say Fuck after being cut off In total complaints were made to Ofcom however the regulator chose not to investigate because the comedy sketches were inexplicit and consistent with the live unpredictable format of this established charity programme whilst recognising that some were not to everyone s taste br In a video featuring Ed Sheeran meeting and rescuing a child in Liberia for Comic Relief was criticised as poverty porn and was given the Rusty Radiator award for the most offensive and stereotypical fundraising video of the year br Writing in The Guardian in Labour MP David Lammy argued that Comic Relief perpetuated problematic stereotypes of Africa and that they had a responsibility to use its powerful position to move the debate on in a more constructive way by establishing an image of African people as equals br In in response to Lammy s comments and the backlash to Sheeran s video Comic Relief announced they would take steps towards change by halting their use of celebrities for appeals br However in February Lammy also criticised Stacey Dooley for posting on social media about her trip to Uganda for Comic Relief saying that the world does not need any more white saviours and that she was perpetuating tired and unhelpful stereotypes about Africa The pressure group No White Saviours argued that Comic Relief had pledged to make changes to their celebrity campaigns in the past and now needed to put them into practice br The remarks by Lammy were believed to have damaged coverage of Red Nose Day viewership dropped and the donations received for the broadcast in March fell by million and the money raised that year was the lowest since In as a result of Lammy s intervention Comic Relief announced that it would no longer send celebrities to Africa nor portray Africa with images of starving people or critically ill children Instead they would be using local film makers to provide a more authentic perspective and give agency back to African people br br br Similar
