Electrical wiring is an electrical installation of cabling and associated devices such as switches distribution boards sockets and light fittings in a structure br Wiring is subject to safety standards for design and installation Allowable wire and cable types and sizes are specified according to the circuit operating voltage and electric current capability with further restrictions on the environmental conditions such as ambient temperature range moisture levels and exposure to sunlight and chemicals br Associated circuit protection control and distribution devices within a building s wiring system are subject to voltage current and functional specifications Wiring safety codes vary by locality country or region The International Electrotechnical Commission IEC is attempting to harmonise wiring standards among member countries but significant variations in design and installation requirements still exist br br br Wiring codes of practice and regulations br br Wiring installation codes and regulations are intended to protect people and property from electrical shock and fire hazards They are usually based on a model code with or without local amendments produced by a national or international standards organisation such as the IEC br br br Australia and New Zealand br br In Australia and New Zealand the AS NZS standard commonly known as the wiring rules specifies requirements for the selection and installation of electrical equipment and the design and testing of such installations The standard is mandatory in both New Zealand and Australia therefore all electrical work covered by the standard must comply br br br Europe br In European countries an attempt has been made to harmonise national wiring standards in an IEC standard IEC Electrical Installations for Buildings Hence national standards follow an identical system of sections and chapters However this standard is not written in such language that it can readily be adopted as a national wiring code Neither is it designed for field use by electrical tradespeople and inspectors for testing compliance with national wiring standards By contrast national codes such as the NEC or CSA C generally exemplify the common objectives of IEC but provide specific rules in a form that allows for guidance of those installing and inspecting electrical systems br br br Germany br The VDE is the organisation responsible for the promulgation of electrical standards and safety specifications DIN VDE is the German wiring regulations document harmonised with IEC In Germany blue can also mean phase or switched phase br br br United Kingdom br In the United Kingdom wiring installations are regulated by the Institution of Engineering and Technology Requirements for Electrical Installations IEE Wiring Regulations BS which are harmonised with IEC The th edition issued in January included new sections for microgeneration and solar photovoltaic systems The first edition was published in In the th edition of the wiring regulations BS was released and came into force in January and BS Amendment was issued March BS is the standard to which the UK electrical industry adheres and compliance with BS is now required by law through the Electricity Safety Quality and Continuity Regulations br br br North America br br The first electrical codes in the United States originated in New York in to regulate installations of electric lighting Since the US National Fire Protection Association a private non profit association formed by insurance companies has published the National Electrical Code NEC States counties or cities often include the NEC in their local building codes by reference along with local differences The NEC is modified every three years It is a consensus code considering suggestions from interested parties The proposals are studied by committees of engineers tradesmen manufacturer representatives fire fighters and other invitees br Since the Canadian Standards Association CSA has produced the Canadian Safety Standard for Electrical Installations which is the basis for provincial electrical codes The CSA also produces the Canadian Electrical Code the edition of which references IEC Electrical Installations for Buildings and states that the code addresses the fundamental principles of electrical protection in Section The Canadian code reprints Chapter of IEC but there are no numerical criteria listed in that chapter to assess the adequacy of any electrical installation br Although the US and Canadian national standards deal with the same physical phenomena and broadly similar objectives they differ occasionally in technical detail As part of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA program US and Canadian standards are slowly converging toward each other in a process known as harmonisation br br br Colour coding of wiring by region br br In a typical electrical code some colour coding of wires is mandatory Many local rules and exceptions exist per country state or region Older installations vary in colour codes and colours may fade with insulation exposure to heat light and aging br br br Europe br As of March the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization CENELEC requires the use of green yellow colour cables as protective conductors blue as neutral conductors and brown as single phase conductors br br br Sweden br In Sweden IEC is implemented through the national standard SS Notable is the exception for blue where while the colour normally is used for neutral may be used as connecting wire between switches and between switch and fixture as well as phase wire in a two phase circuit all under the condition that no neutral wire is used in the particular circuit br br br United Kingdom br br The United Kingdom requires the use of wire covered with green yellow striped insulation for safety earthing grounding connections This growing international standard was adopted for its distinctive appearance to reduce the likelihood of dangerous confusion of safety earthing grounding wires with other electrical functions especially by persons affected by red green colour blindness br In the UK adopted the European Union standard for phase colours of brown black and grey and for neutral blue However the old phase colours of red yellow and blue with black for neutral are still found in old installations Single phase wiring should strictly be in brown red in old system regardless of which phase it originated from but it is common practice to use three core cable in the three phase colours for two way lighting switches The accepted practice is to sleeve the ends of the cores in brown or blue sleeves as appropriate br br br United States br br The United States National Electrical Code requires a bare copper or green or green yellow insulated protective conductor a white or grey neutral with any other colour used for single phase The NEC also requires the high leg conductor of a high leg delta system to have orange insulation or to be identified by other suitable means such as tagging Prior to the adoption of orange as the suggested colour for the high leg in the NEC it was common practice in some areas to use red for this purpose br The introduction of the NEC clearly states that it is not intended to be a design manual and therefore creating a colour code for ungrounded or hot conductors falls outside the scope and purpose of the NEC However it is a common misconception that hot conductor colour coding is required by the Code br In the United States colour coding of three phase system conductors follows a de facto standard wherein black red and blue are used for three phase volt systems and brown orange or violet and yellow are used in volt systems Violet avoids conflict with the NEC s high leg delta rule In buildings with multiple voltage systems the grounded conductors neutrals of both systems are required to be separately identified and made distinguishable to avoid cross system connections Most often volt systems use white insulation while volt systems use grey insulation although this particular colour code is not currently an explicit requirement of the NEC Some local jurisdictions do specify required colour coding in their local building codes however br br br Color codes br br br Wiring methods br br Materials for wiring interior electrical systems in buildings vary depending on br br Intended use and amount of power demand on the circuit br Type of occupancy and size of the building br National and local regulations br Environment in which the wiring must operate br Wiring systems in a single family home or duplex for example are simple with relatively low power requirements infrequent changes to the building structure and layout usually with dry moderate temperature and non corrosive environmental conditions In a light commercial environment more frequent wiring changes can be expected large apparatus may be installed and special conditions of heat or moisture may apply Heavy industries have more demanding wiring requirements such as very large currents and higher voltages frequent changes of equipment layout corrosive or wet or explosive atmospheres In facilities that handle flammable gases or liquids special rules may govern the installation and wiring of electrical equipment in hazardous areas br Wires and cables are rated by the circuit voltage temperature rating and environmental conditions moisture sunlight oil chemicals in which they can be used A wire or cable has a voltage to neutral rating and a maximum conductor surface temperature rating The amount of current a cable or wire can safely carry depends on the installation conditions br The international standard wire sizes are given in the IEC standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission In North America the American Wire Gauge standard for wire sizes is used br br br Cables br br br Modern wiring materials br Modern non metallic sheathed cables such as US and Canadian Types NMB and NMC consist of two to four wires covered with thermoplastic insulation plus a wire for Protective Earthing Grounding bonding surrounded by a flexible plastic jacket In North America and the UK this conductor is usually bare wire but in the UK it is required that this bare Protective Earth PE conductor be sheathed in Green Yellow insulating tubing where the Cable Sheathing has been removed Most other jurisdictions now require the Protective Earth conductor to be insulated to the same standard as the current carrying conductors with Green Yellow insulation br With some cables the individual conductors are wrapped in paper before the plastic jacket is applied br Special versions of non metallic sheathed cables such as US Type UF are designed for direct underground burial often with separate mechanical protection or exterior use where exposure to ultraviolet radiation UV is a possibility These cables differ in having a moisture resistant construction lacking paper or other absorbent fillers and being formulated for UV resistance br Rubber like synthetic polymer insulation is used in industrial cables and power cables installed underground because of its superior moisture resistance br Insulated cables are rated by their allowable operating voltage and their maximum operating temperature at the conductor surface A cable may carry multiple usage ratings for applications for example one rating for dry installations and another when exposed to moisture or oil br Generally single conductor building wire in small sizes is solid wire since the wiring is not required to be very flexible Building wire conductors larger than AWG or about mm are stranded for flexibility during installation but are not sufficiently pliable to use as appliance cord br Cables for industrial commercial and apartment buildings may contain many insulated conductors in an overall jacket with helical tape steel or aluminium armour or steel wire armour and perhaps as well an overall PVC or lead jacket for protection from moisture and physical damage Cables intended for very flexible service or in marine applications may be protected by woven bronze wires Power or communications cables e g computer networking that are routed in or through air handling spaces plenums of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in metal conduit or rated for low flame and smoke production br br For some industrial uses in steel mills and similar hot environments no organic material gives satisfactory service Cables insulated with compressed mica flakes are sometimes used Another form of high temperature cable is mineral insulated cable with individual conductors placed within a copper tube and the space filled with magnesium oxide powder The whole assembly is drawn down to smaller sizes thereby compressing the powder Such cables have a certified fire resistance rating and are more costly than non fire rated cable They have little flexibility and behave more like rigid conduit rather than flexible cables br The environment of the installed wires determine how much current a cable is permitted to carry Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors those circuits are always rated at a lower ampacity Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor voltage potential insulation type and thickness and the temperature rating of the cable itself The allowable current will also be different for wet or dry locations for hot attic or cool underground locations In a run of cable through several areas the part with the lowest rating becomes the rating of the overall run br Cables usually are secured with special fittings where they enter electrical apparatus this may be a simple screw clamp for jacketed cables in a dry location or a polymer gasketed cable connector that mechanically engages the armour of an armoured cable and provides a water resistant connection Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present To prevent loosening of the connections of individual conductors of a cable cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs In tall buildings special designs are required to support the conductors of vertical runs of cable Generally only one cable per fitting is permitted unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables br Special cable constructions and termination techniques are required for cables installed in ships Such assemblies are subjected to environmental and mechanical extremes Therefore in addition to electrical and fire safety concerns such cables may also be required to be pressure resistant where they penetrate a vessel s bulkheads They must also resist corrosion caused by salt water or salt spray which is accomplished through the use of thicker specially constructed jackets and by tinning the individual wire stands br br In North American practice for residential and light commercial buildings fed with a single phase split service an overhead cable from a transformer on a power pole is run to the service entrance point The cable is a three conductor twisted triplex cable with a bare neutral and two insulated conductors with no overall cable jacket The neutral conductor is often a supporting messenger steel wire which is used to support the insulated line conductors br br br Copper conductors br br Electrical devices often use copper conductors because of their properties including their high electrical conductivity tensile strength ductility creep resistance corrosion resistance thermal conductivity coefficient of thermal expansion solderability resistance to electrical overloads compatibility with electrical insulators and ease of installation Copper is used in many types of electrical wiring br br br Aluminium conductors br br Aluminium wire was common in North American residential wiring from the late s to mid s due to the rising cost of copper Because of its greater resistivity aluminium wiring requires larger conductors than copper For instance instead of AWG American wire gauge copper wire aluminium wiring would need to be AWG on a typical ampere lighting circuit though local building codes vary br Solid aluminium conductors were originally made in the s from a utility grade aluminium alloy that had undesirable properties for a building wire and were used with wiring devices intended for copper conductors These practices were found to cause defective connections and fire hazards In the early s new aluminium wire made from one of several special alloys was introduced and all devices breakers switches receptacles splice connectors wire nuts etc were specially designed for the purpose These newer aluminium wires and special designs address problems with junctions between dissimilar metals oxidation on metal surfaces and mechanical effects that occur as different metals expand at different rates with increases in temperature br Unlike copper aluminium has a tendency to creep or cold flow under pressure so older plain steel screw clamped connections could become loose over time Newer electrical devices designed for aluminium conductors have features intended to compensate for this effect Unlike copper aluminium forms an insulating oxide layer on the surface This is sometimes addressed by coating aluminium conductors with an antioxidant paste containing zinc dust in a low residue polybutene base at joints or by applying a mechanical termination designed to break through the oxide layer during installation br Some terminations on wiring devices designed only for copper wire would overheat under heavy current load and cause fires when used with aluminium conductors Revised standards for wire materials and wiring devices such as the CO ALR copper aluminium revised designation were developed to reduce these problems While larger sizes are still used to feed power to electrical panels and large devices aluminium wiring for residential use has acquired a poor reputation and has fallen out of favour br Aluminium conductors are still heavily used for bulk power transmission power distribution and large feeder circuits with heavy current loads due to the various advantages they offer over copper wiring Aluminium conductors both cost and weigh less than copper conductors so a much larger cross sectional area can be used for the same weight and price This can compensate for the higher resistance and lower mechanical strength of aluminium meaning the larger cross sectional area is needed to achieve comparable current capacity and other features Aluminium conductors must be installed with compatible connectors and special care must be taken to ensure the contact surface does not oxidise br br br Raceways and cable runs br br Insulated wires may be run in one of several forms between electrical devices This may be a specialised bendable pipe called a conduit or one of several varieties of metal rigid steel or aluminium or non metallic PVC or HDPE tubing Rectangular cross section metal or PVC wire troughs North America or trunking UK may be used if many circuits are required Wires run underground may be run in plastic tubing encased in concrete but metal elbows may be used in severe pulls Wiring in exposed areas for example factory floors may be run in cable trays or rectangular raceways having lids br Where wiring or raceways that hold the wiring must traverse fire resistance rated walls and floors the openings are required by local building codes to be firestopped In cases where safety critical wiring must be kept operational during an accidental fire fireproofing must be applied to maintain circuit integrity in a manner to comply with a product s certification listing The nature and thickness of any passive fire protection materials used in conjunction with wiring and raceways has a quantifiable impact upon the ampacity derating because the thermal insulation properties needed for fire resistance also inhibit air cooling of power conductors br br Cable trays are used in industrial areas where many insulated cables are run together Individual cables can exit the tray at any point simplifying the wiring installation and reducing the labour cost for installing new cables Power cables may have fittings in the tray to maintain clearance between the conductors but small control wiring is often installed without any intentional spacing between cables br Local electrical regulations may restrict or place special requirements on mixing of voltage levels within one cable tray Good design practices may segregate for example low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits br Since wires run in conduits or underground cannot dissipate heat as easily as in open air and since adjacent circuits contribute induced currents wiring regulations give rules to establish the current capacity ampacity br Special sealed fittings are used for wiring routed through potentially explosive atmospheres br br br Bus bars bus duct cable bus br br For very high currents in electrical apparatus and for high currents distributed through a building bus bars can be used The term bus is a contraction of the Latin omnibus meaning for all Each live hot conductor of such a system is a rigid piece of copper or aluminium usually in flat bars but sometimes as tubing or other shapes Open bus bars are never used in publicly accessible areas although they are used in manufacturing plants and power company switch yards to gain the benefit of air cooling A variation is to use heavy cables especially where it is desirable to transpose or roll phases br In industrial applications conductor bars are often pre assembled with insulators in grounded enclosures This assembly known as bus duct or busway can be used for connections to large switchgear or for bringing the main power feed into a building A form of bus duct known as plug in bus is used to distribute power down the length of a building it is constructed to allow tap off switches or motor controllers to be installed at designated places along the bus The big advantage of this scheme is the ability to remove or add a branch circuit without removing voltage from the whole duct br br Bus ducts may have all phase conductors in the same enclosure non isolated bus or may have each conductor separated by a grounded barrier from the adjacent phases segregated bus For conducting large currents between devices a cable bus is used br For very large currents in generating stations or substations where it is difficult to provide circuit protection an isolated phase bus is used Each phase of the circuit is run in a separate grounded metal enclosure The only fault possible is a phase to ground fault since the enclosures are separated This type of bus can be rated up to amperes and up to hundreds of kilovolts during normal service not just for faults but is not used for building wiring in the conventional sense br br br Electrical panels br br Electrical panels are easily accessible junction boxes used to reroute and switch electrical services The term is often used to refer to circuit breaker panels or fuseboxes Local codes can specify physical clearance around the panels br br br Degradation by pests br Squirrels rats and other rodents may gnaw on unprotected wiring causing fire and shock hazards This is especially true of PVC insulated telephone and computer network cables Several techniques have been developed to deter these pests including insulation loaded with pepper dust br br br Early wiring methods br br The first interior power wiring systems used conductors that were bare or covered with cloth which were secured by staples to the framing of the building or on running boards Where conductors went through walls they were protected with cloth tape Splices were done similarly to telegraph connections and soldered for security Underground conductors were insulated with wrappings of cloth tape soaked in pitch and laid in wooden troughs which were then buried Such wiring systems were unsatisfactory because of the danger of electrocution and fire plus the high labour cost for such installations br The first electrical codes arose in the s with the commercial introduction of electrical power however many conflicting standards existed for the selection of wire sizes and other design rules for electrical installations and a need was seen to introduce uniformity on the grounds of safety br br br Knob and tube US br br The earliest standardized method of wiring in buildings in common use in North America from about to the s was knob and tube K T wiring single conductors were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs attached to the structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires Since air was free to circulate over the wires smaller conductors could be used than required in cables By arranging wires on opposite sides of building structural members some protection was afforded against short circuits that can be caused by driving a nail into both conductors simultaneously br By the s the labor cost of installing two conductors rather than one cable resulted in a decline in new knob and tube installations However the US code still allows new K T wiring installations in special situations some rural and industrial applications br br br Metal sheathed wires br br In the United Kingdom an early form of insulated cable introduced in consisted of two impregnated paper insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath Joints were soldered and special fittings were used for lamp holders and switches These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time Paper insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior wiring installations because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture did not affect the insulation br A system later invented in the UK in employed vulcanised rubber insulated wire enclosed in a strip metal sheath The metal sheath was bonded to each metal wiring device to ensure earthing continuity br A system developed in Germany called Kuhlo wire used one two or three rubber insulated wires in a brass or lead coated iron sheet tube with a crimped seam The enclosure could also be used as a return conductor Kuhlo wire could be run exposed on surfaces and painted or embedded in plaster Special outlet and junction boxes were made for lamps and switches made either of porcelain or sheet steel The crimped seam was not considered as watertight as the Stannos wire used in England which had a soldered sheath br A somewhat similar system called concentric wiring was introduced in the United States around In this system an insulated electrical wire was wrapped with copper tape which was then soldered forming the grounded return conductor of the wiring system The bare metal sheath at earth potential was considered safe to touch While companies such as General Electric manufactured fittings for the system and a few buildings were wired with it it was never adopted into the US National Electrical Code Drawbacks of the system were that special fittings were required and that any defect in the connection of the sheath would result in the sheath becoming energised br br br Other historical wiring methods br Armored cables with two rubber insulated conductors in a flexible metal sheath were used as early as and were considered at the time a better method than open knob and tube wiring although much more expensive br The first rubber insulated cables for US building wiring were introduced in with US patent Burley Harry Rooney Henry Insulated electric wire issued assigned to Boston Insulated Wire and Cable These were two or more solid copper electrical wires with rubber insulation plus woven cotton cloth over each conductor for protection of the insulation with an overall woven jacket usually impregnated with tar as a protection from moisture Waxed paper was used as a filler and separator br Over time rubber insulated cables become brittle because of exposure to atmospheric oxygen so they must be handled with care and are usually replaced during renovations When switches socket outlets or light fixtures are replaced the mere act of tightening connections may cause hardened insulation to flake off the conductors Rubber insulation further inside the cable often is in better condition than the insulation exposed at connections due to reduced exposure to oxygen br The sulfur in vulcanized rubber insulation attacked bare copper wire so the conductors were tinned to prevent this The conductors reverted to being bare when rubber ceased to be used br br About PVC insulation and jackets were introduced especially for residential wiring About the same time single conductors with a thinner PVC insulation and a thin nylon jacket e g US Type THN THHN etc became common br The simplest form of cable has two insulated conductors twisted together to form a unit Such non jacketed cables with two or more conductors are used only for extra low voltage signal and control applications such as doorbell wiring br Other methods of securing wiring that are now obsolete include br br Re use of existing gas pipes when converting gas lighting installations to electric lighting Insulated conductors were pulled through the pipes that had formerly supplied the gas lamps Although used occasionally this method risked insulation damage from sharp edges inside the pipe at each joint br Wood mouldings with grooves cut for single conductor wires covered by a wooden cap strip These were prohibited in North American electrical codes by Wooden moulding was also used to some degree in the UK but was never permitted by German and Austrian rules br A system of flexible twin cords supported by glass or porcelain buttons was used near the turn of the th century in Europe but was soon replaced by other methods br During the first years of the th century various patented forms of wiring system such as Bergman and Peschel tubing were used to protect wiring these used very thin fibre tubes or metal tubes which were also used as return conductors br In Austria wires were concealed by embedding a rubber tube in a groove in the wall plastering over it then removing the tube and pulling wires through the cavity br Metal moulding systems with a flattened oval section consisting of a base strip and a snap on cap channel were more costly than open wiring or wooden moulding but could be easily run on wall surfaces Similar surface mounted raceway wiring systems are still available today br br br See also br a frequently used MIL SPEC compliant wire br Bus
