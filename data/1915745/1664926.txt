The Rolls Royce Griffon is a British litre cu in capacity degree V liquid cooled aero engine designed and built by Rolls Royce Limited In keeping with company convention the Griffon was named after a bird of prey in this case the griffon vulture br Design work on the Griffon started in at the request of the Fleet Air Arm for use in new aircraft designs such as the Fairey Firefly In it was also decided that the engine could be adapted for use in the Spitfire Development was stopped temporarily to concentrate efforts on the smaller Merlin and the cylinder Vulture the engine did not go into production until the early s br The Griffon was the last in the line of V aero engines to be produced by Rolls Royce with production ceasing in Griffon engines remain in Royal Air Force service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight br br br Design and development br br br Origins br br According to Arthur Rubbra s memoirs a de rated version of the R engine known by the name Griffon at that time was tested in This engine R which was never flown was used for Moderately Supercharged Buzzard development which was not proceeded with until much later and bore no direct relationship to the volume produced Griffon of the s br In the Fleet Air Arm approached Rolls Royce and asked whether a larger version of the Merlin could be designed The requirements were that the new engine have good power at low altitude and that it be reliable and easy to service Work began on the design of the engine soon afterwards The design process was relatively smooth compared with that of the Merlin and the first of three prototype Griffon Is first ran in the Experimental Department on November br Although the Griffon was designed for naval aircraft on November N E Rowe of the Air Ministry suggested fitting the Griffon in a Spitfire Three weeks later permission was given to Supermarine to explore the possibilities of adapting the Griffon to the Spitfire in response Supermarine issued Specification on December This decision led to a change in the disposition of the engine accessories to reduce the frontal area of the engine as much as possible As a result the frontal area of the bare Griffon engine was square feet m compared with square feet m of the Merlin despite the Griffon s much larger capacity This redesigned engine first ran on June and went into production as the Griffon II br In early with the expected Battle of Britain looming on the orders of Lord Beaverbrook Minister of Aircraft Production work on the new engine had been halted temporarily to concentrate on the smaller L cu in Merlin which had already surpassed the output achieved with the early Griffon br br br Design br br Compared with earlier Rolls Royce designs the Griffon engine featured several improvements which meant that it was physically only slightly larger than the Merlin in spite of its larger capacity of litres cu in br One significant difference was the incorporation of the camshaft and magneto drives into the propeller reduction gears at the front of the engine rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient The drive for the supercharger was also taken from the front of the engine which had previously required a long shaft to run to its location at the back of the engine br The Merlin engine s crankshaft lubrication was via a gallery cut into the engine block to feed each main bearing and then onto a secondary adjacent big end bearing via a gallery in the crankshaft itself The crankpin was second in line to the main bearing in oil flow and pressure with oil having to flow through the main bearing first The Griffon improved on this arrangement being the first Rolls Royce production aero engine to use a hollow crankshaft as the means of lubricating the main and big end bearings with oil being fed from each end of the crankshaft giving even flow to all bearings br In another change from convention one high efficiency B T H manufactured dual magneto was mounted on top of the propeller reduction casing earlier Rolls Royce designs using twin magnetos mounted at the rear of the engine br The Griffon series introduced a two stage supercharger and other design changes the pressure oil pumps were now housed internally within the sump and an effort was made to remove as many external pipes as possible In addition the drive for the supercharger was moved to the crankshaft at the back of the engine via a short torsion shaft rather than at the front of the engine using a long drive shaft as used by earlier Griffon variants br Production of the aero version of the Griffon ended in December while a marine version the Sea Griffon continued to be produced for the RAF s High Speed Launches br br br Basic component overview Griffon br From Jane s and Flight br br Cylinders br Twelve cylinders consisting of high carbon steel floating wet liners set in two two piece cylinder blocks of cast aluminium alloy having separate heads and skirts Cylinder liners chromium plated in the bores for inches from the head Cylinder blocks mounted with an included degree angle onto inclined upper faces of a two piece crankcase Cylinder heads fitted with cast iron inlet valve guides phosphor bronze exhaust valve guides and renewable Silchrome steel alloy valve seats Two diametrically opposed spark plugs protrude into each combustion chamber br Pistons br Machined from R R alloy forgings Fully floating gudgeon pins of hardened nickel chrome steel Two compression and one drilled oil control ring above the gudgeon pin and another drilled oil control ring below br Connecting rods br H section machined nickel steel forgings each pair consisting of a plain and a forked rod The forked rod carries a nickel steel bearing block which accommodates steel backed lead bronze alloy bearing shells The small end of each rod houses a floating phosphor bronze bush br Crankshaft br One piece machined from a nitrogen hardened nickel chrome molybdenum steel forging Statically and dynamically balanced Seven main bearings and six throws Internal oilway with feed from both ends used to distribute lubricants to main and big end bearings Floating front end bearing consisting of an internally toothed annulus bolted to crankshaft meshing with and incorporating a semi floating ring internally splined to a short coupling shaft Coupling shaft splined at front end to driving wheel of propeller reduction gear Clockwise rotation when viewed from rear br Crankcase br Two aluminium alloy castings joined together on the horizontal centreline The upper portion bears the wheelcase cylinder blocks and part of the housing for the airscrew reduction gear and carries the crankshaft main bearings split mild steel shells lined with lead bronze alloy The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the main pressure oil pump supercharger change speed operating pump and two scavenge pumps It also houses the main coolant pump which is driven through the same gear train as the oil pumps br Wheelcase br Aluminium alloy casting fitted to rear of crankcase Carries the supercharger and houses drives to the supercharger auxiliary gearbox coupling engine speed indicator airscrew constant speed unit intercooler pump and fuel pump as well as the oil and coolant pumps in the lower half crankcase br Valve gear br Two inlet and two exhaust poppet valves of K E austenitic nickel chrome steel per cylinder Exhaust valves have sodium cooled stems Brightray nickel chromium protective coating to the whole of the combustion face and seat of the exhaust valves and to the seat only of the inlet valves Each valve is held closed by a pair of concentric coil springs A single seven bearing camshaft located centrally on the top of each cylinder head operates individual steel rockers pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner intake side of the block to actuate the exhaust valves the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the block to actuate the inlet valves br br br Engine capacity mass flow and supercharging br Although it is common practice to compare different piston engines and their performance potential by referring to the engine displacement or swept volume this does not give an accurate reading of an engine s capabilities According to A C Lovesey who was in charge of the Merlin s development The impression still prevails that the static capacity known as the swept volume is the basis of comparison of the possible power output for different types of engine but this is not the case because the output of the engine depends solely on the mass of air it can be made to consume efficiently and in this respect the supercharger plays the most important role br Unlike the Merlin the Griffon was designed from the outset to use a single stage supercharger driven by a two speed hydraulically operated gearbox the initial production versions the Griffon II III IV and VI series were designed to give their maximum power at low altitudes and were mainly used by the Fleet Air Arm The Griffon and series featured two stage supercharging and achieved their maximum power at low to medium altitudes The Griffon and series engines collectively designated Griffon SML used a two stage three speed supercharger adding a set of Low Supercharger L S gears to the already existing Medium and Full Supercharger M S and F S gears Another modification was to increase the diameters of both impellers thus increasing the rated altitudes at which maximum power could be generated in each gear While the continued to drive a five blade propeller the and series were designed to drive contra rotating propellers In a Griffon was fitted to the Supermarine Spiteful XVI RB a re engined production Mk XIV this aircraft achieved a maximum speed of mph km h with full military equipment br br br Pilot transition br Pilots who converted from the Merlin to the Griffon engined Spitfires soon discovered that because the Griffon engine s propeller rotated in the opposite direction to that of the Merlin the fighter swung to the right on takeoff rather than to the left This tendency was even more marked with the more powerful and series Griffon engines with their five bladed propellers As a result pilots had to learn to apply left port trim on takeoff instead of the right starboard trim they were used to applying On takeoff the throttle had to be opened slowly as the pronounced swing to the right could lead to crabbing and severe tyre wear br Some test Spitfire XIVs s and s were fitted with contra rotating propellers which eliminated the torque effect Early problems with the complex gearbox that was required for contra rotating propellers prevented them from ever becoming operational in Spitfires but they were used on later aircraft including the Seafire FR Mk and F and FR which were fitted with Griffon s driving contra rotating propellers as standard equipment The Griffon and A series installed in Universal Power Plant UPP installations and driving contra rotating propellers was used in the Avro Shackleton maritime patrol aircraft br br br Variants br The Griffon was produced in approximately different variants the Griffon being the last in the
