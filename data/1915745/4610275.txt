The TVR Cerbera is a car manufactured by the British company TVR between and Its name is derived from Cerberus the three headed beast of Greek legend that guarded the entrance of Hades It is a coup with a hardtop roof and a seating layout that has been described as a sports car and a grand touring car br Introduced at the London Motor Show the Cerbera was the third car manufactured by TVR under the leadership of Peter Wheeler the first was the Griffith and the second was the Chimaera The car marked three milestones for the Wheeler led company br br The first hard top the Griffith and the Chimaera were both convertibles br The first TVRs were traditionally two seaters br The first to be powered by TVR s own engines historically TVR had purchased engines from mainstream manufacturers like Rover Ford and Triumph br br br Engines br Prior to the Cerbera TVR had purchased V engines from Rover and then tuned them for their own use When Rover was purchased by BMW Peter Wheeler did not want to risk supply chain problems should the Germans decide to stop manufacturing the engine In response he engaged the services of race engineer Al Melling to design a V engine that TVR could manufacture in house and even potentially offer for sale to other car makers In an interview for the television programme Top Gear Wheeler explained Basically we designed the engine as a race engine It was my idea at the time that if we wanted to expand we ought to make something that we could sell to other people We ve ended up with a degree V with a flat plane crank The bottom half of the engine to the heads is exactly as you would see in current Formula One engines br br The result was called the Speed Eight official designation AJP after Al Melling John Ravenscroft and Peter Wheeler a litre V rated at hp kW and gave the Cerbera a top speed of km h mph A litre version of the engine was later offered with hp kW br The AJP has one of the highest specific outputs of any naturally aspirated V in the automotive world at hp litre for the and hp litre for the Later models of the litre engine had the Red Rose option which increased output to hp kW hp litre when run with super unleaded high octane petrol An unmarked button on the dashboard altered the engine mapping br The engine is also unusually compact for a V According to TVR the total weight of the finished engine is kg lb br Following the success of the Speed Eight engine program Peter Wheeler also undertook the design of a Speed Six engine This engine also made its debut in the Cerbera but was a litre inline slant six design with four valves per cylinder to the Speed Eight s two The early engines proved unreliable with many requiring rebuilding br br br Specifications br br The Cerbera was designed from the start as a four seater The rear seats are smaller than the front a design commonly referred to as a However the interior is designed so that the passenger seat can slide farther forward than the driver s seat This allows more room for the person sitting behind the front passenger TVR have referred to the layout as a design br The Cerbera s weight was quoted by TVR at kg lb although customers claimed the weight varied between kg lb and kg lb br The dashboard was designed especially for the Cerbera and uses a two spar steering wheel as opposed to the typical three spar previously found in most TVRs The reason for this is that minor instruments are located on a small panel below the steering wheel and a third spar in the wheel would have made them difficult to read br Like all TVRs of the Peter Wheeler era the Cerbera had a long travel throttle to compensate for the lack of electronic traction control and very sharp steering The V powered cars were two turns from lock to lock and the Speed Six car was turns This made it easier for experienced drivers to maintain or regain control of the car in the event of a loss of traction but some less experienced drivers complained that it made the cars feel twitchy and more responsive than they would otherwise have preferred br br In TVR changed the styling of the car slightly by modifying the headlights to more closely resemble those seen on the Tuscan The facelift features were available with all three engine configurations In addition the cars equipped with the litre engine were offered with the lightweight option reducing the overall weight through the use of lighter body panels and a slightly reworked interior br br br Performance br br br The Last Cerbera br In August TVR held an online auction for what it billed as The Last Cerbera According to thelastcerbera com the website that TVR created especially for the auction TVR s owner and chairman Nikolay Smolensky brought the design out of retirement for one more unit as an homage to the beautiful but brutish bygone British sports car The last Cerbera was a Lightweight right hand drive car in Pepper white with Prussian blue leather interior trim The auction failed to meet its reserve price but TVR still decided to sell the car to the high bidder The final bid was under to which plus VAT would be added br br br Cerbera Speed br br The TVR Cerbera Speed originally known as the Project is a high performance sports car designed by TVR in Based on the TVR Cerbera the vehicle was intended to be both the world s highest performance road car and the basis for a GT class endurance racer However problems during its development changing GT class regulations and the eventual decision that it was simply incapable of being used as a road car forced TVR executives to abandon its development br The engine displacing L cu in and having twelve cylinders was reportedly capable of producing nearly hp kW although an exact measurement was never made Nonetheless it was claimed to have a top speed greater than that of the McLaren F br br br br Sources br br Notes br Top Gear review of the TVR Cerbera by Jeremy Clarkson br Classics Sports Car
