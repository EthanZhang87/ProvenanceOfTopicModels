id: 33303
The Wankel engine va k l VUN kell is a type of internal combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion The concept was proven by German engineer Felix Wankel followed by a commercially feasible engine designed by German engineer Hanns Dieter Paschke The Wankel engine s rotor which creates the turning motion is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with the sides having less curvature The rotor spins inside a figure eight like epitrochoidal housing around a fixed toothed gearing The midpoint of the rotor moves in a circle around the output shaft rotating the shaft via a cam br In its basic gasoline fuelled form the Wankel engine has lower thermal efficiency and higher exhaust emissions when compared to the four stroke reciprocating piston engine The thermal inefficiency has restricted the engine to limited use since its introduction in the s However many disadvantages have mainly been overcome over the succeeding decades as the production of road going vehicles progressed The advantages of compact design smoothness lower weight and fewer parts over the reciprocating piston internal combustion engines make the Wankel engine suited for applications such as chainsaws auxiliary power units loitering munitions aircraft jet skis snowmobiles and range extenders in cars The Wankel engine was also used to power motorcycles and racing cars br br br Concept br br The Wankel engine is a type of rotary piston engine and exists in two primary forms the Drehkolbenmotor DKM rotary piston engine designed by Felix Wankel see Figure and the Kreiskolbenmotor KKM circuitous piston engine designed by Hanns Dieter Paschke see Figure of which only the latter has left the prototype stage Thus all production Wankel engines are of the KKM type br br In a DKM engine there are two rotors the inner trochoid shaped rotor and the outer rotor which has an outer circular shape and an inner figure eight shape The center shaft is stationary and torque is taken off the outer rotor which is geared to the inner rotor br In a KKM engine the outer rotor is part of the stationary housing thus not a moving part The inner shaft is a moving part with an eccentric lobe for the inner rotor to spin around The rotor spins around its center and around the axis of the eccentric shaft in a hula hoop fashion resulting in the rotor making one complete revolution for every three revolutions of the eccentric shaft In the KKM engine torque is taken off the eccentric shaft making it a much simpler design to be adopted to conventional powertrains br br br Wankel engine development br Felix Wankel designed a rotary compressor in the s and received his first patent for a rotary type of engine in He realized that the triangular rotor of the rotary compressor could have intake and exhaust ports added producing an internal combustion engine Eventually in Wankel began working at German firm NSU Motorenwerke to design a rotary compressor as a supercharger for NSU s motorcycle engines Wankel conceived the design of a triangular rotor in the compressor With the assistance of Prof Othmar Baier from Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences the concept was defined mathematically The supercharger he designed was used for one of NSU s cm one cylinder two stroke engines The engine produced a power output of PS kW at rpm br In NSU agreed to develop a rotary internal combustion engine with Felix Wankel based upon Wankel s supercharger design for their motorcycle engines Since Wankel was known as a difficult colleague the development work for the DKM was carried out at Wankel s private Lindau design bureau According to John B Hege Wankel received help from his friend Ernst H ppner who was a brilliant engineer The first working prototype DKM see figure first ran on February at the NSU research and development department Versuchsabteilung TX It produced PS kW Soon after that a second prototype of the DKM was built It had a working chamber volume Vk of cm and also produced kW PS at rpm It could even reach speeds of up to rpm However these engine speeds distorted the outer rotor s shape thus proving impractical According to Mazda Motors engineers and historians four units of the DKM engine were built the design is described to have a displacement Vh of cm equivalent to a working chamber volume Vk of cm The fourth unit built is said to have received several design changes and eventually produced PS kW at rpm it could reach speeds up to rpm One of the four engines built has been on static display at the Deutsches Museum Bonn see figure br Due to its complicated design with a stationary center shaft the DKM engine was impractical Wolf Dieter Bensinger explicitly mentions that proper engine cooling cannot be achieved in a DKM engine and argues that this is the reason why the DKM design had to be abandoned NSU development chief engineer Walter Froede solved this problem by using Hanns Dieter Paschke s design and converting the DKM into what would later be known as the KKM see figure The KKM proved to be a much more practical engine as it has easily accessible spark plugs a simpler cooling design and a conventional power take off shaft Wankel disliked Froede s KKM engine because of its inner rotor s eccentric motion which was not a pure circular motion as Wankel had intended He remarked that his race horse was turned into a plough horse Wankel also complained that more stresses would be placed on the KKM s apex seals due to the eccentric hula hoop motion of the rotor NSU could not afford to finance the development of both the DKM and the KKM and eventually decided to drop the DKM in favor of the KKM because the latter seemed to be the more practical design br Wankel obtained the US patent on the KKM engine on June Throughout the design phase of the KKM Froede s engineering team had to solve problems such as repeated bearing seizures the oil flow inside the engine and the engine cooling The first fully functioning KKM engine the KKM weighing in at only kg lb displaced cm and produced PS kW at rpm Its first run was on July br In NSU produced the first series production Wankel engine for a car the KKM see Figure It was used in the NSU Spider sports car of which about were made Despite its teething troubles the KKM was a powerful engine with decent potential smooth operation and low noise emissions at high engine speeds It was a single rotor PP engine with a displacement of cm in a rated power of kW hp at rpm and a BMEP of MPa lbf in br br br Operation and design br br The Wankel engine has a spinning eccentric power take off shaft with a rotary piston riding on eccentrics on the shaft in a hula hoop fashion The Wankel is a type of rotary engine i e its housing s inner side resembles a two lobes oval like epitrochoid equivalent to a peritrochoid In contrast its rotary piston has a three vertices trochoid shape similar to a Reuleaux triangle Thus the Wankel engine s rotor constantly forms three moving working chambers The Wankel engine s basic geometry is depicted in figure Seals at the rotor s apices seal against the housing s periphery The rotor moves in its rotating motion guided by gears and the eccentric output shaft not being guided by the external chamber The rotor does not make contact with the external engine housing The force of expanded gas pressure on the rotor exerts pressure on the center of the eccentric part of the output shaft br All practical Wankel engines are four cycle i e four stroke engines In theory two cycle engines are possible but they are impractical because the intake gas and the exhaust gas cannot be properly separated The operating principle is similar to the Otto operating principle the Diesel operating principle with its compression ignition cannot be used in a practical Wankel engine Therefore Wankel engines typically have a high voltage spark ignition system br In a Wankel engine one side of the triangular rotor completes the four stage Otto cycle of intake compression expansion and exhaust each revolution of the rotor equivalent to three shaft revolutions see Figure The shape of the rotor between the fixed apexes is to minimize the volume of the geometric combustion chamber and maximize the compression ratio respectively As the rotor has three sides this gives three power pulses per revolution of the rotor br Wankel engines have a much lower degree of irregularity when compared to a reciprocating piston engine making the Wankel engine run much smoother This is because the Wankel engine has a lower moment of inertia and less excess torque area due to its more uniform torque delivery For instance a two rotor Wankel engine runs more than twice as smoothly as a four cylinder piston engine The eccentric output shaft of a Wankel engine also does not have the stress related contours of a reciprocating piston engine s crankshaft The maximum revolutions of a Wankel engine are thus mainly limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above or rpm In practice automotive Wankel engines are not operated at much higher output shaft speeds than reciprocating piston engines of similar output power Wankel engines in auto racing are operated at speeds up to rpm but so are four stroke reciprocating piston engines with relatively small displacement per cylinder In aircraft they are used conservatively up to or rpm br br br Chamber volume br In a Wankel rotary engine the chamber volume br br br br br V br br k br br

the frequency br br br Considering two chambers br Richard Franz Ansdale Wolf Dieter Bensinger and Felix Wankel based their analogy on the number of cumulative expansion strokes per shaft revolution In a Wankel rotary engine the eccentric shaft must make three full rotations per combustion chamber to complete all four phases of a four stroke engine Since a Wankel rotary engine has three combustion chambers all four phases of a four stroke engine are completed within one full rotation of the eccentric shaft and one power pulse is produced at each revolution of the shaft This is different from a four stroke piston engine which needs to make two full rotations per combustion chamber to complete all four phases of a four stroke engine Thus in a Wankel rotary engine according to

transferred to a special design bureau at the AvtoVAZ plant John B Hege argues that no license was issued to any Soviet car manufacturer br br br Engineering br br Felix Wankel managed to overcome most of the problems that made previous attempts to perfect the rotary engines fail by developing a configuration with vane seals having a tip radius equal to the amount of oversize of the rotor housing form as compared to the theoretical epitrochoid to minimize radial apex seal motion plus introducing a cylindrical gas loaded apex pin which abutted all sealing elements to seal around the three planes at each rotor apex br In the early days unique dedicated production machines had to be built for different housing dimensional arrangements However patented designs such as U S patent G J Watt for a Wankel Engine Cylinder Generating Machine U S patent Apparatus for machining and or treatment of trochoidal surfaces and U S patent Device for machining trochoidal inner walls and others solved the problem br Wankel engines have a problem not found in reciprocating piston four stroke engines in that the block housing has intake compression combustion and exhaust occurring at fixed locations around the housing This causes a very uneven thermal load on the rotor housing In contrast four stroke reciprocating engines perform these four strokes in one chamber so that extremes of freezing intake and flaming exhaust are averaged and shielded by a boundary layer from overheating working parts The University of Florida proposed the use of heat pipes in an air cooled Wankel to overcome this uneven heating of the block housing Pre heating of certain housing sections with exhaust gas improved performance and fuel economy also reducing wear and emissions br The boundary layer shields and the oil film act as thermal insulation leading to a low temperature of the lubricating film approximate maximum C or F on a water cooled Wankel engine This gives a more constant surface temperature The temperature around the spark plug is about the same as in the combustion chamber of a reciprocating engine With circumferential or axial flow cooling the temperature difference remains tolerable br Problems arose during research in the s and s For a while engineers were faced with what they called chatter marks and devil s scratch in the inner epitrochoid surface resulting in chipping of the chrome coating of the trochoidal surfaces They discovered that the cause was the apex seals reaching a resonating vibration and the problem was solved by reducing the thickness and weight of the apex seals as well as using more suitable materials Scratches disappeared after introducing more compatible materials for seals and housing coatings Yamamoto experimentally lightened apex seals with holes Now weight was identified as the main cause Mazda then used aluminum impregnated carbon apex seals in their early production engines NSU used carbon antimony impregnated apex seals against chrome NSU developed ELNISIL coating to production maturity and returned to a metal sealing strip for the RO Mazda continued to use chrome but provided the aluminum housing with a steel jacket which was then coated with a thin dimensional galvanized chrome layer This allowed Mazda to return to the mm and later even mm thick metal apex seals Another early problem was the build up of cracks in the stator surface near the plug hole which was eliminated by installing the spark plugs in a separate metal insert copper sleeve in the housing instead of a plug being screwed directly into the block housing br Toyota found that substituting a glow plug for the leading site spark plug improved low rpm part load specific fuel consumption by and emissions and idle A later alternative solution to spark plug boss cooling was provided with a variable coolant velocity scheme for water cooled rotaries which has had widespread use being patented by Curtiss Wright with the last listed for better air cooled engine spark plug boss cooling These approaches did not require a high conductivity copper insert but did not preclude its use Ford tested a Wankel engine with the plugs placed in the side plates instead of the usual placement in the housing working surface CA br br br Torque delivery br Wankel engines are capable of high speed operation meaning they do not necessarily need to produce high torque to produce high power The positioning of the intake port and intake port closing greatly affect the engine s torque production Early closing of the intake port increases low end torque but reduces high end torque and thus power In contrast late closing of the intake port reduces low end torque while increasing torque at high engine speeds thus resulting in more power at higher engine speeds br A peripheral intake port gives the highest mean effective pressure however side intake porting produces a more steady idle because it helps to prevent blow back of burned gases into the intake ducts which cause misfirings caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite Peripheral porting PP gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range but PP was also linked to worse idle stability and part load performance Early work by Toyota led to the addition of a fresh air supply to the exhaust port It also proved that a Reed valve in the intake port or ducts improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines by preventing blow back of exhaust gas into the intake port and ducts and reducing the misfire inducing high EGR at the cost of a slight loss of power at top rpm Elasticity is improved with a greater rotor eccentricity analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine br Wankel engines operate better with a low pressure exhaust system Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure more severely in peripheral intake port engines The Mazda RX Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs and there have been studies of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines Side intake ports as used in Mazda s Renesis engine were first proposed by Hanns Dieter Paschke in the late s Paschke predicted that precisely calculated intake ports and intake manifolds could make a side port engine as powerful as a PP engine br br br Materials br As previously described the Wankel engine is affected by unequal thermal expansion due to the four cycles taking place in fixed places of the engine While this puts great demands on the materials used the simplicity of the Wankel makes it easier to use alternative materials such as exotic alloys and ceramics A commonplace method is for engine housings made of aluminum to use a spurted molybdenum layer on the engine housing for the combustion chamber area and a spurted steel layer elsewhere Engine housings cast from iron can be induction brazed to make the material suited for withstanding combustion heat stress br Among the alloys cited for Wankel housing use are A Inconel and treated to T hardness Several materials have been used for plating the housing working surface Nikasil being one Citro n Daimler Benz Ford A P Grazen and others applied for patents in this field For the apex seals the choice of materials has evolved along with the experience gained from carbon alloys to steel ferritic stainless Ferro TiC and other materials The combination of housing plating and the apex and side seal materials was determined experimentally to obtain the best duration of both seals and housing cover For the shaft steel alloys with little deformation on load are preferred the use of Maraging steel has been proposed for this br Leaded petrol fuel was the predominant type available in the first years of the Wankel engine s development Lead is a solid lubricant and leaded petrol is designed to reduce the wearing of seals and housings The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of petrol s lubricating qualities As leaded petrol was being phased out Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the petrol to provide lubrication to critical engine parts An SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton s choices of materials and cooling fins br br br Sealing br Early engine designs had a high incidence of sealing loss both between the rotor and the housing and also between the various pieces making up the housing Also in earlier model Wankel engines carbon particles could become trapped between the seal and the casing jamming the engine and requiring a partial rebuild It was common for very early Mazda engines to require rebuilding after miles km Further sealing problems arose from the uneven thermal distribution within the housings causing distortion and loss of sealing and compression This thermal distortion also caused uneven wear between the apex seal and the rotor housing evident on higher mileage engines The problem was exacerbated when the engine was stressed before reaching operating temperature However Mazda Wankel engines solved these initial problems Current engines have nearly seal related parts br The problem of clearance for hot rotor apexes passing between the axially closer side housings in the cooler intake lobe areas was dealt with by using an axial rotor pilot radially inboard of the oils seals plus improved inertia oil cooling of the rotor interior C W US C Jones US M Bentele C Jones A H Raye and slightly crowned apex seals different height in the center and in the extremes of seal br br br Fuel economy and emissions br As is described in the thermodynamic disadvantages section the early Wankel engines had poor fuel economy This is caused by the Wankel engine s design of combustion chamber shape and huge surface area The Wankel engine s design is on the other hand much less prone to engine knocking which allows using low octane fuels without reducing compression NSU tested at the suggestion of Felix Wankel low octane gasoline On a trial basis octane gasoline was produced by BV Aral which was used in the Wankel DKM test engine with a compression ratio of it ran without complaint This upset the petrochemical industry in Europe which had invested considerable sums of money in new plants for the production of higher quality gasoline Direct injection stratified charge engines can be operated with fuels with particularly low octane numbers Such as diesel fuel which only has an octane number of As a result of the poor efficiency a Wankel engine with peripheral exhaust porting has a larger amount of unburnt hydrocarbons HC released into the exhaust The exhaust is however relatively low in nitrogen oxide NOx emissions because the combustion is slow and temperatures are lower than in other engines and also because of the Wankel engine s good exhaust gas recirculation EGR behavior Carbon monoxide CO emissions of Wankel and Otto engines are about the same The Wankel engine has a significantly higher tK K exhaust gas temperature than an Otto engine especially under low and medium load conditions This is because of the higher combustion frequency and slower combustion Exhaust gas temperatures can exceed K under high load at engine speeds of rpm To improve the exhaust gas behavior of the Wankel engine a thermal reactor or catalyst converter may be used to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide from the exhaust Mazda uses a dual ignition system with two spark plugs per chamber This increases the power output and at the same time reduces HC emissions At the same time HC emissions can be lowered by reducing the pre ignition of the T leading plug compared to the L trailing plug This leads to internal afterburning and reduces HC emissions On the other hand the same ignition timing of L and T leads to a higher energy conversion Hydrocarbons adhering to the combustion chamber wall are expelled into the exhaust at the peripheral outlet Mazda used spark plugs in their R B engine per chamber The third spark plug ignites the mixture in the trailing side before the squish is generated causing the mixture to burn completely and also speeding up flame propagation which improves fuel consumption According to Curtiss Wright research the factor that controls the amount of unburnt hydrocarbons in the exhaust is the rotor surface temperature with higher temperatures resulting in fewer hydrocarbons in the exhaust Curtiss Wright widened the rotor keeping the rest of engine s architecture unchanged thus reducing friction losses and increasing displacement and power output The limiting factor for this widening was mechanical especially shaft deflection at high rotative speeds Quenching is the dominant source of hydrocarbon at high speeds and leakage at low speeds Using side porting which enables closing the exhaust port around the top dead center and reducing intake and exhaust overlap helps improving fuel consumption br Mazda s RX car with the Renesis engine that was first presented in met in the United States low emissions vehicle LEV II standard This was mainly achieved by using side porting The exhaust ports which in earlier Mazda rotary engines were located in the rotor housings were moved to the side of the combustion chamber This approach allowed Mazda to eliminate overlap between intake and exhaust port openings while simultaneously increasing the exhaust port area This design improved the combustion stability in the low speed and light load range The HC emissions from the side exhaust port rotary engine are less than those from the peripheral exhaust port Wankel engine Peripheral ported rotary engines have a better mean effective pressure especially at high rpm and with a rectangular shaped intake port However the RX was not improved to meet Euro emission regulations and it was discontinued in The new Mazda C of the Mazda MX R EV meets the Euro d ISC FCM emissions standard br br br Laser ignition br Laser ignition was first proposed in but first studies of laser ignition were only conducted in It is assumed that laser ignition of lean fuel mixtures in Wankel engines could improve fuel consumption and exhaust gas behavior In a study a Wankel model engine was tested with laser ignition and various gaseous and liquid fuels Laser ignition leads to a faster center of combustion development thus improving combustion speed and leading to a reduction in NOx emissions The laser pulse energy required for proper ignition is reasonable in the low single digit mJ range A significant modification of the Wankel engine is not required for laser ignition br br br Compression ignition Wankel br br Research has been undertaken into rotary compression ignition engines The basic design parameters of the Wankel engine preclude obtaining a compression ratio sufficient for Diesel operation in a practical engine The Rolls Royce and Yanmar compression ignition approach was to use a two stage unit see figure with one rotor acting as compressor while combustion takes place in the other Both engines were not functional br br br Multifuel Wankel engine br A different approach from a compression ignition Diesel Wankel engine is a non CI multifuel Wankel engine that is capable of operating on a huge variety of fuels diesel petrol kerosene methanol natural gas and hydrogen German engineer Dankwart Eiermann designed this engine at Wankel SuperTec WST in the early s It has a chamber volume of cm cc and an indicated power output of kW horsepower per rotor Versions with one up to four rotors are possible br The WST engine has a common rail direct injection system operating on a stratified charge principle Similar to a Diesel engine and unlike a conventional Wankel engine the WST engine compresses air rather than an air fuel mixture as in the four cycle engine compression phase Fuel is only injected into the compressed air shortly before top dead centre which results in stratified charge i e no homogeneous mixture A spark plug is used to initiate combustion The pressure at the end of the compression phase and during combustion is lower than in a conventional Diesel engine and the fuel consumption is equivalent to that of a small indirect injection compression ignition engine i e g kW h br Diesel fuel powered variants of the WST Wankel engine are being used as APUs in Deutsche Bahn diesel locomotives The WST diesel fuel engines can produce up to kW horse power br br br Hydrogen fuel br br As a hydrogen air fuel mixture is quicker to ignite with a faster burning rate than gasoline an important issue of hydrogen internal combustion engines is to prevent pre ignition and backfire In a rotary engine each cycle of the Otto cycle occurs in different chambers Importantly the intake chamber is separated from the combustion chamber keeping the air fuel mixture away from localized hot spots Wankel engines also do not have hot exhaust valves which eases adapting them to hydrogen operation Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines In a Wankel engine the problem of a hydrogenate attack is circumvented by using ceramic apex seals br In a prototype Wankel engine fitted to a Mazda RX to research hydrogen operation Wakayama et al found that hydrogen operation improved thermal efficiency by over petrol fuel operation Although the lean operation emits little NOx total amount of engine out NOx br exceeds Japanese SULEV standard The supplementary stoichiometic operation combined with a catalyst br provides additional NOx reduction Accordingly the vehicle satisfies the SULEV standard br br br Advantages br Prime advantages of the Wankel engine are br br A far higher power to weight ratio than a piston engine br Easier to package in small engine spaces than an equivalent piston engine br Able to reach higher engine speeds than a comparable piston engine br Operating with almost no vibration br Not prone to engine knock br Cheaper to mass produce because the engine contains fewer parts br Supplying torque for about two thirds of the combustion cycle rather than one quarter for a piston engine br Easily adapted and highly suitable to use hydrogen fuel br Wankel engines are considerably lighter and simpler containing far fewer moving parts than piston engines of equivalent power output Valves or complex valve trains are eliminated by using simple ports cut into the walls of the rotor housing Since the rotor rides directly on a large bearing on the output shaft there are no connecting rods and no crankshaft The elimination of reciprocating mass gives Wankel engines a low non uniformity coefficient meaning that they operate much smoother than comparable reciprocating piston engines For instance a two rotor Wankel engine is more than twice as smooth in its operation as a four cylinder reciprocating piston engine br A four stroke cylinder produces a power stroke only every other rotation of the crankshaft with three strokes being pumping losses The Wankel engine also has higher volumetric efficiency than a reciprocating piston engine Because of the quasi overlap of the power strokes the Wankel engine is very quick to react to power increases giving a quick delivery of power when the demand arises especially at higher engine speeds This difference is more pronounced when compared to four cylinder reciprocating engines and less pronounced when compared to higher cylinder counts br Due to the absence of hot exhaust valves the fuel octane requirements of Wankel engines are lower than in reciprocating piston engines As a rule of thumb it may be assumed that a Wankel engine with a working chamber volume Vk of cm and a compression of runs well on mediocre quality petrol with an octane rating of just RON If in a reciprocating piston engine the compression must be reduced by one unit of compression to avoid knock then in a comparable Wankel engine a reduction in compression may not be required br Because of the lower injector count fuel injection systems in Wankel engines are cheaper than in reciprocating piston engines An injection system that allows stratified charge operation may help reduce rich mixture areas in undesirable parts of the engine which improves fuel efficiency br br br Disadvantages br br br Thermodynamic disadvantages br Wankel rotary engines mainly suffer from poor thermodynamics caused by the Wankel engine s design with its huge surface area and poor combustion chamber shape As an effect of this the Wankel engine has slow and incomplete combustion which results in high fuel consumption and bad exhaust gas behavior Wankel engines can reach a typical maximum efficiency of about percent br In a Wankel rotary engine fuel combustion is slow because the combustion chamber is long thin and moving Flame travel occurs almost exclusively in the direction of rotor movement adding to the poor quenching of the fuel and air mixture being the main source of unburnt hydrocarbons at high engine speeds The trailing side of the combustion chamber naturally produces a squeeze stream that prevents the flame from reaching the chamber s trailing edge which worsens the consequences of the fuel and air mixture quenching poorly Direct fuel injection in which fuel is injected towards the leading edge of the combustion chamber can minimize the amount of unburnt fuel in the exhaust br br br Mechanical disadvantages br Although many of the disadvantages are the subject of ongoing research the current disadvantages of the Wankel engine in production are the following br br Rotor sealing br The engine housing has vastly different temperatures in each separate chamber section The different expansion coefficients of the materials lead to imperfect sealing Additionally both sides of the apex seals are exposed to fuel and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from excess oil in the combustion areas of the engine such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil By comparison a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against Additionally only one side of the piston in a four stroke piston engine is exposed to fuel allowing oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates and the associated thermal dilatation inequities a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of the engine The heat pipes effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine resulting in decreases in efficiency and performance In small displacement charge cooled rotor air cooled housing Wankel engines that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from to C to F and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of the engine from to C to F br Apex seal lifting br Centrifugal force pushes the apex seal onto the housing surface forming a firm seal Gaps can develop between the apex seal and trochoid housing in light load operation when imbalances in centrifugal force and gas pressure occur At low engine rpm ranges or under low load conditions the gas pressure in the combustion chamber can cause the seal to lift off the surface resulting in combustion gas leaking into the next chamber Mazda developed a solution changing the shape of the trochoid housing which meant that the seals remained flush with the housing Using the Wankel engine at sustained higher revolutions helps eliminate apex seal lift off making it viable in applications such as electricity generation In motor vehicles the engine is suited to series hybrid applications NSU circumvented this problem by adding slots on one side of the apex seals thus directing the gas pressure into the base of the apex This effectively prevented the apex seals from lifting off br Although in two dimensions the seal system of a Wankel looks to be even simpler than that of a corresponding multi cylinder piston engine in three dimensions the opposite is true As well as the rotor apex seals evident in the conceptual diagram the rotor must also seal against the chamber ends br Piston rings in reciprocating engines are not perfect seals each has a gap to allow for expansion The sealing at the apexes of the Wankel rotor is less critical because leakage is between adjacent chambers on adjacent strokes of the cycle rather than to the mainshaft case Although sealing has improved over the years the less than effective sealing of the Wankel which is mostly due to lack of lubrication remains a factor reducing its efficiency br The trailing side of the rotary engine s combustion chamber develops a squeeze stream that pushes back the flame front With the conventional one or two spark plug system and homogenous mixture this squeeze stream prevents the flame from propagating to the combustion chamber s trailing side in the mid and high engine speed ranges Kawasaki dealt with that problem in its US patent US Toyota obtained a economy improvement by placing a glow plug in the leading side and using Reed Valves in intake ducts In two stroke engines metal reeds last about km miles while carbon fiber around km miles This poor combustion in the trailing side of the chamber is one of the reasons why there is more carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons in a Wankel s exhaust stream A side port exhaust as is used in the Mazda Renesis avoids port overlap one of the causes of this because the unburned mixture cannot escape The Mazda B avoided this problem through the use of a three spark plug ignition system and obtained a complete conversion of the aspirated mixture In the B the upper late trailing spark plug ignites before the onset of the squeeze flow br br br Regulations and taxation br National agencies that tax automobiles according to displacement and regulatory bodies in automobile racing use a variety of equivalency factors to compare Wankel engines to four stroke piston engines Greece for instance taxed cars based on the working chamber volume the face of one rotor multiplied by the number of rotors lowering the cost of ownership Japan did the same but applied an equivalency factor of making Mazda s B engine fit just under the liter tax limit FIA used an equivalency factor of but later increased it to using the displacement formula described by Bensinger However the DMSB applies an equivalency factor of in motorsport br br br Car applications br br The first rotary engined car for sale was the NSU Rotary Spider Rotary engines were continuously fitted in cars until when Mazda discontinued the RX Mazda introduced a rotary engined hybrid electric car the MX R EV in br br br NSU and Mazda br Mazda and NSU signed a study contract to develop the Wankel engine in and competed to bring the first Wankel powered automobile to the market Although Mazda produced an experimental rotary that year NSU was the first with a rotary automobile for sale the sporty NSU Spider in Mazda countered with a display of two and four rotor rotary engines at that year s Tokyo Motor Show In NSU began production of a rotary engined luxury car the Ro NSU had not produced reliable apex seals on the rotor though unlike Mazda and Curtiss Wright NSU had problems with apex seals wear poor shaft lubrication and poor fuel economy leading to frequent engine failures not solved until which led to large warranty costs curtailing further NSU rotary engine development This premature release of the new rotary engine gave a poor reputation for all makes and even when these issues were solved in the last engines produced by NSU in the second half of the s sales did not recover br By early Audi engineers Richard van Basshuysen and Gottlieb Wilmers had designed a new generation of the Audi NSU Wankel engine the KKM It was a two rotor unit with a chamber volume Vk of cm derived from an eccentricity of mm a generating radius of mm and equidistance of mm and a housing width of mm It had double side intake ports and a peripheral exhaust port it was fitted with a continuously injecting Bosch K Jetronic multipoint manifold injection system According to the DIN standard it produced kW at rpm and could provide a max torque of N m at rpm Van Basshuysen and Wilmers designed the engine with either a thermal reactor or a catalytic converter for emissions control The engine had a mass of kg and a BSFC of approximately g kW h at rpm and a BMEP of kPa For testing two KKM engines were installed in Audi Type test cars one with a five speed manual gearbox and one with a three speed automatic gearbox br br br Mazda br Mazda claimed to have solved the apex seal problem operating test engines at high speed for hours without failure After years of development Mazda s first rotary engine car was the Cosmo S The company followed with several Wankel rotary in the company s terminology vehicles including a bus and a pickup truck Customers often cited the cars smoothness of operation However Mazda chose a method to comply with hydrocarbon emission standards which while less expensive to produce increased fuel consumption br Mazda later abandoned the rotary in most of their automotive designs continuing to use the engine in their sports car range only The company normally used two rotor designs A more advanced twin turbo three rotor engine was fitted in the Eunos Cosmo sports car In Mazda introduced the Renesis engine fitted in the RX The Renesis engine relocated the ports for exhaust from the periphery of the rotary housing to the sides allowing for larger overall ports and better airflow The Renesis is capable of hp kW with improved fuel economy reliability and lower emissions than previous Mazda rotary engines all from a nominal L displacement but this was not enough to meet more stringent emissions standards Mazda ended production of their rotary engine in after the engine failed to meet the more stringent Euro emission standards leaving no automotive company selling a rotary powered road vehicle until br Mazda launched the MX R EV hybrid fitted with a Wankel engine range extender in March The Wankel engine has no direct connection to the wheels and serves only to charge the battery It is a single rotor unit with a cm in engine and a rated power output of kW hp The engine has petrol direct injection exhaust gas recirculation and an exhaust gas treatment system with a Three way catalyst and a particulate filter The engine is Euro d ISC FCM compliant br br br Citro n br Citro n did much research producing the M and GS Birotor cars and the RE helicopter using engines produced by Comotor a joint venture by Citro n and NSU br br br Daimler Benz br Daimler Benz fitted a Wankel engine in their C concept car The C II s engine was naturally aspirated fitted with petrol direct injection and had four rotors The total displacement was L cubic inches and the compression ration was It provided a maximum torque of N m kp m at rpm and a produced a power output of kW PS at rpm br br br American Motors br American Motors Corporation AMC was so convinced that the rotary engine will play an important role as a powerplant for cars and trucks of the future that the chairman Roy D Chapin Jr signed an agreement in February after a year s negotiations to build rotary engines for both passenger cars and military vehicles and the right to sell any rotary engines it produced to other companies AMC s president William Luneburg did not expect dramatic development through to but Gerald C Meyers AMC s vice president of the engineering product group suggested that AMC should buy the engines from Curtiss Wright before developing its own rotary engines and predicted a total transition to rotary power by br Plans called for the engine to be used in the AMC Pacer but development was pushed back American Motors designed the unique Pacer around the engine By AMC had decided to purchase the General Motors GM rotary instead of building an engine in house Both GM and AMC confirmed the relationship would be beneficial in marketing the new engine with AMC claiming that the GM rotary achieved good fuel economy GM s engines had not reached production when the Pacer was launched onto the market The oil crisis played a part in frustrating the use of the rotary engine Rising fuel prices and speculation about proposed US emission standards legislation also increased concerns br br br General Motors br At its annual meeting in May General Motors unveiled the Wankel engine it planned to use in the Chevrolet Vega By GM R D had not succeeded in producing a Wankel engine meeting both the emission requirements and good fuel economy leading to a decision by the company to cancel the project Because of that decision the R D team only partly released the results of its most recent research which claimed to have solved the fuel economy problem and built reliable engines with a lifespan above miles km Those findings were not taken into account when the cancellation order was issued The ending of GM s rotary project required AMC who was to purchase the engine to reconfigure the Pacer to house its AMC straight engine driving the rear wheels br br br AvtoVAZ br In the Soviet Union created a special engine design bureau which in designed

to be another kg lighter than the B In addition Group C Category had only permitted liter naturally aspirated engines and had no fuel quantity limits br br br As a vehicle range extender br br Due to the compact size and the high power to weight ratio of a Wankel engine it has been proposed for electric vehicles as range extenders to provide supplementary power when electric battery levels are low A Wankel engine used as a generator has packaging noise vibration and harshness advantages when used in a passenger car maximizing interior passenger and luggage space as well as providing a good noise and vibration emissions profile However it is questionable whether or not the inherent disadvantages of the Wankel engine allow the usage of the Wankel engine as a range extender for passenger cars br In Audi unveiled a prototype series hybrid electric car the A e tron It incorporated a Wankel engine with a chamber volume Vk of cm capable of producing kW at rpm It was mated to an electric generator which recharged the car s batteries as needed and provided electricity directly to the electric driving motor The package had a mass of kg and could produce kW of electric power br br In

Suzuki br From to Suzuki produced its RE single rotor Wankel motorcycle It was a complex design with both liquid cooling and oil cooling and multiple lubrication and carburetor systems It worked well and was smooth but it did not sell well because it was heavy and had a modest power output of hp kW br Suzuki opted for a complicated oil cooling and water cooling system The exhaust pipes become very hot with Suzuki opting for a finned exhaust manifold twin skinned exhausted pipes with cooling grilles heatproof pipe wrappings and silencers with heat shields Suzuki had three lube systems while Garside had a single total loss oil injection system that fed both the main bearings and the intake manifolds Suzuki chose a single rotor that was fairly smooth but with rough patches at rpm Suzuki mounted the massive rotor high in the frame br Although it was described to handle well the result was that the Suzuki was heavy overcomplicated expensive to manufacture and at bhp short on power br

br br Aircraft br br In principle rotary engines are ideal for light aircraft being light compact almost vibrationless and with a high power to weight ratio Further aviation benefits of a rotary engine include br br The engine is not susceptible to shock cooling during descent br The engine does not require an enriched mixture for cooling at high power br Having no reciprocating parts there is less vulnerability to damage when the engine revolves at a higher rate than the designed maximum br Unlike cars and motorcycles a rotary aero engine will be sufficiently warm before full power is asked of it because of the time taken for pre flight checks Also the journey to the runway has minimum cooling which further permits the engine to reach the operating temperature for full power on take off A Wankel aero engine spends most of its operational time at high power outputs with little idling br Since rotary engines operate at a relatively high rotational speed at rpm of output shaft the rotor spins only at about one third of that speed With relatively low torque propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units for example the MidWest twin rotor engine has a reduction gearbox br The first rotary engine aircraft was in the late s in the experimental Lockheed Q Star civilian version of the United States Army s reconnaissance QT essentially a powered Schweizer sailplane The plane was powered by a hp kW Curtiss Wright RC

In Germany in the mid s a pusher ducted fan airplane powered by a modified NSU multi rotor rotary engine was developed in both civilian and military versions Fanliner and Fantrainer br At roughly the same time as the first experiments with full scale aircraft powered with rotary engines model aircraft sized versions were pioneered by a combination of the well known Japanese O S Engines firm and

basic Wankel design has also been used for gas compressors and superchargers for internal combustion engines but in these cases although the design still offers advantages in reliability the primary
