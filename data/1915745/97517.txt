title: Unintended consequences
id: 97517
In the social sciences unintended consequences sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences more colloquially called knock on effects are outcomes of a purposeful action that are not intended or foreseen The term was popularized in the th century by American sociologist Robert K Merton br Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types br br Unexpected benefit A positive unexpected benefit also referred to as luck serendipity or a windfall br Unexpected drawback An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy e g while irrigation schemes provide people with water for agriculture they can increase waterborne diseases that have devastating health effects such as schistosomiasis br Perverse result A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended when an intended solution makes a problem worse br br br History br br br John Locke br The idea of unintended consequences dates back at least to John Locke who discussed the unintended consequences of interest rate regulation in his letter to Sir John Somers Member of Parliament br br br Adam Smith br The idea was also discussed by Adam Smith the Scottish Enlightenment and consequentialism judging by results br The invisible hand theorem is an example of the unintended consequences of agents acting in their self interest As Andrew S Skinner puts it br The individual undertaker entrepreneur seeking the most efficient allocation of resources contributes to overall economic efficiency the merchant s reaction to price signals helps to ensure that the allocation of resources accurately reflects the structure of consumer preferences and the drive to better our condition contributes to economic growth br br br Marx and Engels br Influenced by th century positivism and Charles Darwin s evolution for both Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx the idea of uncertainty and chance in social dynamics and thus unintended consequences beyond results of perfectly defined laws was only apparent if not rejected since social actions were directed and produced by deliberate human intention br While discerning between the forces that generate changes in nature and those that generate changes in history in his discussion of Ludwig Feuerbach Friedrich Engels touched on the idea of apparent unintended consequences br br In nature there are only blind unconscious agencies acting upon one another In the history of society on the contrary the actors are all endowed with consciousness are men acting with deliberation or passion working towards definite goals nothing happens without a conscious purpose without an intended aim For here also on the whole in spite of the consciously desired aims of all individuals accident apparently reigns on the surface That which is willed happens but rarely in the majority of instances the numerous desired ends cross and conflict with one another or these ends themselves are from the outset incapable of realization or the means of attaining them are insufficient Thus the conflicts of innumerable individual wills and individual actions in the domain of history produce a state of affairs entirely analogous to the realm of unconscious nature The ends of the actions are intended but the results which actually follow from these actions are not intended or when they do seem to correspond to the end intended they ultimately have consequences quite other than those intended Historical events thus appear on the whole to be likewise governed by chance But where on the surface accident holds sway there actually it is always governed by inner hidden laws and it is only a matter of discovering these laws br For his part for Karl Marx what can be understood as unintended consequences are actually consequences that should be expected but are obtained unconsciously These consequences that no one consciously sought would be in the same way as it is for Engels product of conflicts that confront actions from countless individuals The deviation between the original intended goal and the product derived from conflicts would be a marxist equivalent to unintended consequences br This social conflicts would happen as a result of a competitive society and also lead society to sabotage itself and prevent historical progress Thus historical progress in Marxist terms should eliminate these conflicts and make unintended consequences predictable br br br Austrian School br Unintended consequences are a common topic of study and commentary for the Austrian school of economics given its emphasis on methodological individualism This is to such an extent that unexpected consequences can be considered as a distinctive part of Austrian tenets br br br Carl Menger br In Principles of Economics Austrian school founder Carl Menger noted that the relationships that occur in the economy are so intricate that a change in the condition of a single good can have ramifications beyond that good Menger wrote br br If it is established that the existence of human needs capable of satisfaction is a prerequisite of goods character This principle is valid whether the goods can be placed in direct causal connection with the satisfaction of human needs or derive their goods character from a more or less indirect causal connection with the satisfaction of human needs Thus quinine would cease to be a good if the diseases it serves to cure should disappear since the only need with the satisfaction of which it is causally connected would no longer exist But the disappearance of the usefulness of quinine would have the further consequence that a large part of the corresponding goods of higher order would also be deprived of their goods character The inhabitants of quinine producing countries who currently earn their livings by cutting and peeling cinchona trees would suddenly find that not only their stocks of cinchona bark but also in consequence their cinchona trees the tools and appliances applicable only to the production of quinine and above all the specialized labor services by means of which they previously earned their livings would at once lose their goods character since all these things would under the changed circumstances no longer have any causal relationship with the satisfaction of human needs br br br Friedrich Hayek and Catallactics br Economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek is another key figure in the Austrian School of Economics who is notable for his comments on unintended consequences br In The Use of Knowledge in Society Hayek argues that a centrally planned economy cannot reach the level of efficiency of the free market economy because the necessary and pertinent information for decision making is not concentrated but dispersed among a vast number of agents Then for Hayek the price system in the free market allows the members of a society to anonymously coordinate for the most efficient use of resources for example in a situation of scarcity of a raw material the price increase would coordinate the actions of an uncountable amount of individuals in the right direction br The development of this system of interactions would allow the progress of society and individuals would carry it out without knowing all its implications given the dispersion or lack of concentration of information br The implication of this is that the social order which derives from social progress which in turn derives from the economy would be result of a spontaneous cooperation and also an unintended consequence being born from a process of which no individual or group had all the information available or could know all possible outcomes br In the Austrian school this process of social adjustment that generates a social order in an unintendedly way is known as catallactics br For Hayek and the Austrian School the number of individuals involved in the process of creating a social order defines the type of unintended consequence br br If the process involves interactions and decision making of as many individuals members of a society as possible thus gathering the greatest amount of knowledge dispersed among them this process of catallaxy will lead to unexpected benefits a social order and progress br On the other hand attempts by individuals or limited groups who lack all the necessary information to achieve a new or better order will end in unexpected drawbacks br br br Robert K Merton br Sociologist Robert K Merton popularised this concept in the twentieth century br In The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause social change He emphasized that his term purposive action was exclusively concerned with conduct as distinct from behavior That is with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives Merton s usage included deviations from what Max Weber defined as rational social action instrumentally rational and value rational Merton also stated that no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of all social planning is warranted br br br Everyday usage br More recently the law of unintended consequences has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a complex system tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes br Akin to Murphy s law it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the hubristic belief that humans can fully control the world around them not to presuppose a belief in predestination or a lack or a disbelief in that of free will br br br Causes br Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world s inherent complexity parts of a system responding to changes in the environment perverse incentives human stupidity self deception failure to account for human nature or other cognitive or emotional biases As a sub component of complexity in the scientific sense the chaotic nature of the universe and especially its quality of having small apparently insignificant changes with far reaching effects e g the butterfly effect applies br In Robert K Merton listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences br br Ignorance making it impossible to anticipate everything thereby leading to incomplete analysis br Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation br Immediate interests overriding long term interests br Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long term result might be unfavourable these long term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values br Self defeating prophecy or the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs thus the non occurrence of the problem is not anticipated br In addition to Merton s causes psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that groupthink described by Irving Janis has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences br br br Types br br br Unexpected benefits br The creation of no man s lands during the Cold War in places such as the border between Eastern and Western Europe and the Korean Demilitarized Zone has led to large natural habitats br br The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial coral reefs which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers This led to the deliberate sinking of retired ships for the purpose of replacing coral reefs lost to global warming and other factors br In medicine most drugs have unintended consequences side effects associated with their use However some are beneficial For instance aspirin a pain reliever is also an anticoagulant that can help prevent heart attacks and reduce the severity and damage from thrombotic strokes The existence of beneficial side effects also leads to off label use prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose Famously the drug Viagra was developed to lower blood pressure with its use for treating erectile dysfunction being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials br br br Unexpected drawbacks br The implementation of a profanity filter by AOL in had the unintended consequence of blocking residents of Scunthorpe North Lincolnshire England from creating accounts because of a false positive The accidental censorship of innocent language known as the Scunthorpe problem has been repeated and widely documented br In the Australian state of Victoria made safety helmets mandatory for all bicycle riders While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries all else being equal The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased possibly because of risk compensation or due to invisibilisation of cyclists the more a transportation method is uncommonly sighted the likelier it could be deemed to be accident prone br Research by Vulcan et al found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable A health benefit model developed at Macquarie University in Sydney suggests that while helmet use reduces the risk of head or brain injury by approximately two thirds or more the decrease in exercise caused by reduced cycling as a result of helmet laws is counterproductive in terms of net health br Prohibition in the s United States originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade drove many small time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large scale organized crime over the illegal alcohol industry Since alcohol was still popular criminal organisations producing alcohol were well funded and hence also increased their other activities Similarly the War on Drugs intended to suppress the illegal drug trade instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products br In CIA jargon blowback describes the unintended undesirable consequences of covert operations such as the funding of the Afghan Mujahideen and the destabilization of Afghanistan contributing to the rise of the Taliban and Al Qaeda br The introduction of exotic animals and plants for food for decorative purposes or to control unwanted species often leads to more harm than good done by the introduced species br br The introduction of rabbits in Australia and New Zealand for food was followed by an explosive growth in the rabbit population rabbits have become a major feral pest in these countries br Cane toads introduced into Australia to control canefield pests were unsuccessful and have become a major pest in their own right br Kudzu introduced to the US as an ornamental plant in and later used to prevent erosion in earthworks has become a major problem in the Southeastern United States Kudzu has displaced native plants and has effectively taken over significant portions of land br The protection of the steel industry in the United States reduced production of steel in the United States increased costs to users and increased unemployment in associated industries br br br Perverse results br br In Barbra Streisand unsuccessfully sued Kenneth Adelman and Pictopia com for posting a photograph of her home online Before the lawsuit had been filed only people had downloaded the file two of them Streisand s attorneys The lawsuit drew attention to the image resulting in people visiting the site The Streisand Effect was named after this incident describing when an attempt to censor or remove a certain piece of information instead draws attention to the material being suppressed resulting in the material instead becoming widely known reported on and distributed br Passenger side airbags in motorcars were intended as a safety feature but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid s because small children were being hit by airbags that deployed automatically during collisions The supposed solution to this problem moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions br Risk compensation or the Peltzman effect occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death e g bike helmets seatbelts etc People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place This may result in no change or even an increase in morbidity or mortality rather than a decrease as intended br According to an anecdote the British government concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi offered a bounty for every dead cobra This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward Eventually enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income When the government became aware of this they scrapped the reward program causing the cobra breeders to set the now worthless snakes free As a result the wild cobra population further increased The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse becoming known as the Cobra effect br Theobald Mathew s temperance campaign in th century Ireland resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink alcohol again This led to the consumption of diethyl ether a much more dangerous intoxicant owing to its high flammability by those seeking to become intoxicated without breaking the letter of their pledge br It was thought that adding south facing conservatories to British houses would reduce energy consumption by providing extra insulation and warmth from the sun However people tended to use the conservatories as living areas installing heating and ultimately increasing overall energy consumption br A reward for lost nets found along the Normandy coast was offered by the French government between and This resulted in people vandalizing nets to collect the reward br Beginning in the s and continuing into the s the Canadian federal government gave Quebec per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care but only a day per orphan The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so Quebec could receive the larger amount of money This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to people and the children are known as the Duplessis Orphans in reference to the Premier of Quebec who oversaw the scheme Maurice Duplessis br There have been attempts to curb the consumption of sugary beverages by imposing a tax on them However a study found that the reduced consumption was only temporary Also there was an increase in the consumption of beer among households br The New Jersey Childproof Handgun Law which was intended to protect children from accidental discharge of firearms by forcing all future firearms sold in New Jersey to contain smart safety features has delayed if not stopped entirely the introduction of such firearms to New Jersey markets The wording of the law caused significant public backlash fuelled by gun rights lobbyists and several shop owners offering such guns received death threats and stopped stocking them In years after the law was passed it was suggested the law be repealed if gun rights lobbyists agree not to resist the introduction of smart firearms br Drug prohibition can lead drug traffickers to prefer stronger more dangerous substances that can be more easily smuggled and distributed than other less concentrated substances br Televised drug prevention advertisements may lead to increased drug use br Increasing usage of search engines also including recent image search features has contributed in the ease of which media is consumed Some abnormalities in usage may have shifted preferences for pornographic film actors as the producers began using common search queries or tags to label the actors in new roles br The passage of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act has led to a reported increase in risky behaviors by sex workers as a result of quashing their ability to seek and screen clients online forcing them back onto the streets or into the dark web The ads posted were previously an avenue for advocates to reach out to those wanting to escape the trade br The use of precision guided munitions meant to reduce the rate of civilian casualties encouraged armies to narrow their safety margins and increase the use of deadly force in densely populated areas This in turn increased the danger to uninvolved civilians who in the past would have been out of the line of fire because of armies aversion of using higher risk weaponry in densely populated areas The perceived ability to operate precision weaponry from afar where in the past heavy munitions or troop deployment would have been needed also led to the expansion of the list of potential targets As put by Michael Walzer Drones not only make it possible for us to get at our enemies they may also lead us to broaden the list of enemies to include presumptively hostile individuals and militant organizations simply because we can get at them even if they aren t actually involved in attacks against us This idea is also echoed by Gr goire Chamayou In a situation of moral hazard military action is very likely to be deemed necessary simply because it is possible and possible at a lower cost br br br Other br According to Lynn White the invention of the horse stirrup enabled new patterns of warfare that eventually led to the development of feudalism see Stirrup Thesis br br br Perverse consequences of environmental intervention br Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable For example almost all environmental problems from chemical pollution to global warming are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies Traffic congestion deaths and injuries from car accidents air pollution and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the automobile Hospital infections are the unexpected side effect of antibiotic resistance and even human population growth leading to environmental degradation is the side effect of various technological i e agricultural and industrial revolutions br Because of the complexity of ecosystems deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have usually negative unintended consequences Sometimes these effects cause permanent irreversible changes Examples include br br During the Four Pests Campaign a killing of sparrows was declared Chinese leaders later realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects as well as grains Rather than being increased rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased The decision to cull sparrows may itself have been an unintended consequence of silencing intellectuals For years after the establishment of the Communist Government in Chinese scientists and intellectuals found themselves in the midst of turmoil Many scientists were humiliated and intimidated during the nationwide program of thought reform and political indoctrination br During the Great Plague of London a killing of dogs and cats was ordered If left untouched they would have made a significant reduction in the rat population that carried the fleas which transmitted the disease br The installation of smokestacks to decrease pollution in local areas resulting in spread of pollution at a higher altitude and acid rain on an international scale br After about public demand led the US government to fight forest fires in the American West and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires This policy led to fewer fires but also led to growth conditions such that when fires did occur they were much larger and more damaging Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of forest ecology br Side effects of climate engineering to counter global warming could involve even further warming as a consequence of reflectivity reducing afforestation or crop yield reductions and rebound effects after solar dimming measures with even more accelerated warming br br
