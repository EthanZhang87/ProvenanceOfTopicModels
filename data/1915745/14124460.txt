A flame arrester also spelled arrestor deflagration arrester or flame trap is a device or form of construction that will allow free passage of a gas or gaseous mixture but will interrupt or prevent the passage of flame It prevents the transmission of flame through a flammable gas air mixture by quenching the flame on the high surface area provided by an array of small passages through which the flame must pass The emerging gases are cooled enough to prevent ignition on the protected side br br br Principles br Flame arresters are safety devices fitted to openings of enclosures or to pipe work and are intended to allow flow but prevent flame transmission A flame arrester functions by absorbing the heat from a flame front thus dropping the burning gas air mixture below its auto ignition temperature consequently the flame cannot survive The heat is absorbed through channels passages designed into an element These channels are chosen and measured as the MESG maximum experimental safe gap of the gas for a particular installation These passages can be regular like crimped metal ribbon or wire mesh or a sheet metal plate with punched holes or irregular such as those in random packing br The required size of the channels needed to stop the flame front can vary significantly depending on the flammability of the fuel mixture The large openings on a chain link fence are capable of slowing the spread of a small slow burning grass fire but fast burning grass fires will penetrate the fence unless the holes are very small In a coal mine containing highly explosive coal dust or methane the wire mesh of a Davy lamp must be very tightly spaced br For flame arresters used as a safety device the mesh must be protected from damage due to being dropped or struck by another object and the mesh must be capable of rigidly retaining its shape during the propagation of a flame front Any shifting of the individual wires that make up the mesh can create an opening large enough to allow the flame to penetrate and spread beyond the barrier br On a fuel storage vent flame arresters also serve a secondary purpose of allowing air pressure to equalize inside the tank when fuel is added or removed while also preventing insects from flying or crawling into the vent piping and fouling the fuel in the tanks and pipes br br br Usage and applications br The uses of a flame arrester include br br Installed in Combuster Burner air intakes with no pipe or bends before the intake to stop confined and unconfined low pressure deflagrations preventing an ignited atmospheric vapor cloud from propagating beyond the Flame Arrestor outside of a burner flare intake br Prevent the spread of ignited flammable vapor within an enclosed system such as a piping network br Preventing potentially explosive mixtures from propagating after ignition by lightning static electricity or other sources in a vent to atmosphere br Stopping the propagation of a flame traveling at subsonic velocities br Some common objects that have flame arresters are br br Fuel storage tank vents br Fuel gas pipelines br Safety storage cabinets for paint aerosol cans and other flammable mixtures br The exhaust system of internal combustion engines br The air intake of combusters marine gasoline inboard engines and short flare stacks br Davy lamps in coal mining br Overproof rum and other flammable liquors br Portable plastic gasoline containers br br br Safety br Flame arresters should be used only in the gas group and conditions they have been designed and tested for Since the depth on an arrester is specified for certain conditions changes in the temperature pressure or composition of the gases entering the arrester can cause the flame spatial velocity to increase making the design of the arrester insufficient to stop the flame front propagation The deflagration may continue downstream of the arrester br Flame arresters should be periodically inspected to make sure they are free of dirt insects using it as a nest or corrosion The U S Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board concluded that an uninspected and badly corroded flame arrester failed to prevent a explosion at a wastewater treatment plant in Daytona Beach Florida br br br See also br Flashback arrestor Welding equipment br Detonation arrester br Spark arrestor Catcher of flammable debris br br br
