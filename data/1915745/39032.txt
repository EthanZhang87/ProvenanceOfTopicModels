The Rolls Royce Merlin is a British liquid cooled V piston aero engine of litre cu in capacity Rolls Royce designed the engine and first ran it in as a private venture Initially known as the PV it was later called Merlin following the company convention of naming its four stroke piston aero engines after birds of prey The engine benefitted from the racing experiences of precursor engines in the s br After several modifications the first production variants of the PV were completed in The first operational aircraft to enter service using the Merlin were the Fairey Battle Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire The Merlin remains most closely associated with the Spitfire and Hurricane although the majority of the production run was for the four engined Avro Lancaster heavy bomber br The Merlin continued to benefit from a series of rapidly applied developments derived from experiences in use since These markedly improved the engine s performance and durability Starting at horsepower kW for the first production models most late war versions produced just under horsepower kW and the very latest version as used in the de Havilland Hornet over horsepower kW br One of the most successful aircraft engines of the World War II era some versions of the Merlin were built by Rolls Royce in Derby Crewe and Glasgow as well as by Ford of Britain at their Trafford Park factory near Manchester A de rated version was also the basis of the Rolls Royce Rover Meteor tank engine Post war the Merlin was largely superseded by the Rolls Royce Griffon for military use with most Merlin variants being designed and built for airliners and military transport aircraft br The Packard V was a version of the Merlin built in the United States Production ceased in after a total of almost engines had been delivered Merlin engines remain in Royal Air Force service today with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and power many restored aircraft in private ownership worldwide br br br Design and development br br br Origin br In the early s Rolls Royce started planning its future aero engine development programme and realised there was a need for an engine larger than their litre cu in Kestrel which was being used with great success in a number of s aircraft Consequently work was started on a new hp kW class design known as the PV with PV standing for Private Venture cylinder as the company received no government funding for work on the project The PV was first run on October and first flew in a Hawker Hart biplane serial number K on February The engine was originally designed to use the evaporative cooling system then in vogue This proved unreliable and when ethylene glycol from the U S became available the engine was adapted to use a conventional liquid cooling system The Hart was subsequently delivered to Rolls Royce where as a Merlin testbed it completed over hours of flying with the Merlin C and E engines br In the Air Ministry issued a specification F for new fighter aircraft with a minimum airspeed of mph km h Fortunately two designs had been developed the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hawker Hurricane the latter designed in response to another specification F Both were designed around the PV instead of the Kestrel and were the only contemporary British fighters to have been so developed Production contracts for both aircraft were placed in and development of the PV was given top priority as well as government funding Following the company convention of naming its piston aero engines after birds of prey Rolls Royce named the engine the Merlin after a small Northern Hemisphere falcon Falco columbarius br Two more Rolls Royce engines developed just prior to the war were added to the company s range The hp kW Rolls Royce Peregrine was an updated supercharged development of their V Kestrel design while the hp kW litre cu in Rolls Royce Vulture used four Kestrel sized cylinder blocks fitted to a single crankcase and driving a common crankshaft forming an X layout This was to be used in larger aircraft such as the Avro Manchester br Although the Peregrine appeared to be a satisfactory design it was never allowed to mature since Rolls Royce s priority was refining the Merlin As a result the Peregrine saw use in only two aircraft the Westland Whirlwind fighter and one of the Gloster F prototypes The Vulture was fitted to the Avro Manchester bomber but proved unreliable in service and the planned fighter using it the Hawker Tornado was cancelled as a result With the Merlin itself soon pushing into the hp kW range the Peregrine and Vulture were both cancelled in and by mid the Merlin was supplemented in service by the larger Griffon The Griffon incorporated several design improvements and ultimately superseded the Merlin br br br Development br Initially the new engine was plagued with problems such as failure of the accessory gear trains and coolant jackets Several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set Early production Merlins were unreliable common problems were cylinder head cracking coolant leaks and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main

Page Halifax II and V Hawker Hurricane II and IV and Avro Lancaster I and III First Merlin produced by Packard Motor Car Company as V and designated by Rolls Royce as Merlin br br br Production engines br The Merlin II and III series were the first main production versions of the engine The Merlin III was the first version to incorporate a universal propeller shaft allowing either de Havilland or Rotol manufactured propellers to be used br The first major version to incorporate changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX which was designed to run on octane fuel This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger The Merlin XX also utilised the two speed superchargers designed by Rolls Royce resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions Another improvement introduced with the Merlin X was the use of a water glycol coolant mix rather than the glycol of the earlier versions This substantially improved engine life and reliability removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol and reduced the oil leaks that had been a problem with the early Merlin I II and III series br The process of improvement continued with later versions running on higher octane ratings delivering more power Fundamental design changes were also made to all key components again increasing the engine s life and reliability By the end of the war the little engine was delivering over hp kW in common versions and as much as hp kW in the Merlin versions specifically designed for the de Havilland Hornet Ultimately during tests conducted by Rolls Royce at Derby an RM SM the high altitude version of the Merlin Series achieved hp kW at lb boost Hg on octane fuel with water injection br With the end of the war work on improving Merlin power output was halted and the development effort was concentrated on civil derivatives of the Merlin Development of what became the Transport Merlin TML commenced with the Merlin the first Merlin to complete the new civil type test requirements and was aimed at improving reliability and service overhaul periods for airline operators using airliner and transport aircraft such as the Avro Lancastrian Avro York Merlin series Avro Tudor II IV Merlin Tudor IVB V Merlin TCA Canadair North Star Merlin and BOAC Argonaut Merlin IC By the time between overhauls TBO was typically hours depending on use By then single stage engines had accumulated engine hours in civil operation and two stage engines br In addition an exhaust system to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector exhausts was devised for the North Star Argonaut This cross over system took the exhaust flow from the inboard bank of cylinders up and over the engine before discharging the exhaust stream on the outboard side of the UPP nacelle As a result sound levels were reduced by between and decibels The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of hp kW resulting in a knot improvement in true air speed Still air range of the aircraft was also improved by around per cent The modified engine was designated the TMO and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls Royce br Power ratings for the civil Merlin and series was hp kW continuous cruising at feet m and hp kW for take off Merlins were rated at hp kW continuous cruising at feet m and hp kW for take off Engines were available with single stage two speed supercharging series two stage two speed supercharging series and with full intercooling or with half intercooling charge heating charge heating being employed for cold area use

valves have hardened stellited ends while the exhaust valves also have sodium cooled stems and heads protected with a Brightray nickel chromium coating Each valve is kept closed by a pair of concentric coil springs A single seven bearing camshaft located on the top of each cylinder head operates individual steel rockers pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner intake side of the head to actuate the exhaust valves the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the head to actuate the inlet valves br br br Technical improvements br Most of the Merlin s technical improvements resulted from more efficient superchargers designed by Stanley Hooker and the introduction of aviation fuel with increased octane ratings Numerous detail changes were made internally and externally to the engine to withstand increased power ratings and to incorporate advances in engineering practices br br br Ejector exhausts br br The Merlin consumed an enormous volume of air at full power equivalent to the volume of a single decker bus per minute and with the exhaust gases exiting at mph km h it was realised that useful thrust could be gained simply by angling the gases backwards instead of venting sideways br During tests pounds force N kgf thrust at mph km h or roughly hp kW was obtained which increased the level maximum speed of the Spitfire by mph km h to mph km h The first versions of the ejector exhausts featured round outlets while subsequent versions of the system used fishtail style outlets which marginally increased thrust and reduced exhaust glare for night flying br In September the Spitfire prototype K was fitted with ejector type exhausts Later marks of the Spitfire used a variation of this exhaust system fitted with forward facing intake ducts to distribute hot air out to the wing mounted guns to prevent freezing and stoppages at high altitudes replacing an earlier system that used heated air from the engine coolant radiator The latter system had become ineffective due to improvements to the Merlin itself which allowed higher operating altitudes where air temperatures are lower Ejector exhausts were also fitted to other Merlin powered aircraft br br br Supercharger br Central to the success of the Merlin was the supercharger A C Lovesey an engineer who was a key figure in the design of the Merlin delivered a lecture on the development of the Merlin in in this extract he explained the importance of the supercharger br br The impression still prevails that the static capacity known as the swept volume is the basis of comparison of the possible power output for different types of engine but this is not the case because the output of the engine depends solely on the mass of air it can be made to consume efficiently and in this respect the supercharger plays the most important role the engine has to be capable of dealing with the greater mass flows with respect to cooling freedom from detonation and capable of withstanding high gas and inertia loads During the course of research and development on superchargers it became apparent to us that any further increase in the altitude performance of the Merlin engine necessitated the employment of a two stage supercharger br As the Merlin evolved so too did the supercharger the latter fitting into three broad categories br br Single stage single speed gearbox Merlin I to III XII and series br Single stage two speed gearbox experimental Merlin X production Merlin XX br Two stage two speed gearbox with intercooler mainly Merlin and series br The Merlin supercharger was originally designed to allow the engine to generate maximum power at an altitude of about ft m In Stanley Hooker an Oxford graduate in applied mathematics explained I soon became very familiar with the construction of the Merlin supercharger and carburettor Since the supercharger was at the rear of the engine it had come in for pretty severe design treatment and the air intake duct to the impeller looked very squashed Tests conducted by Hooker showed the original intake design was inefficient limiting the performance of the supercharger Hooker subsequently designed a new air intake duct with improved flow characteristics which increased maximum power at a higher altitude of over ft m and also improved the design of both the impeller and the diffuser which controlled the airflow to it These modifications led to the development of the single stage Merlin XX and series br A significant advance in supercharger design was the incorporation in of a two speed drive designed by the French company Farman to the impeller of the Merlin X The later Merlin XX incorporated the two speed drive as well as several improvements that enabled the production rate of Merlins to be increased The low ratio gear which operated from takeoff to an altitude of ft m drove the impeller at rpm and developed hp kW at that height while the high gear s rpm power rating was hp kW at ft m These figures were achieved at rpm engine speed using pounds per square inch atm boost br In after receiving a request in March of that year from the Ministry of Aircraft Production for a high rated ft m Merlin for use as an alternative engine to the turbocharged Hercules VIII used in the prototype high altitude Vickers Wellington V bomber Rolls Royce started experiments on the design of a two stage supercharger and an engine fitted with this was bench tested in April eventually becoming the Merlin The basic design used a modified Vulture supercharger for the first stage while a Merlin supercharger was used for the second A liquid cooled intercooler on top of the supercharger casing was used to prevent the compressed air fuel mixture from becoming too hot Also considered was an exhaust driven turbocharger but although a lower fuel consumption was an advantage the added weight and the need to add extra ducting for the exhaust flow and waste gates meant that this option was rejected in favour of the two stage supercharger Fitted with the two stage two speed supercharger the Merlin series gained hp kW at ft m over the Merlin series at which altitude a Spitfire IX was nearly mph km h faster than a Spitfire V br The two stage Merlin family was extended in with the Merlin which had its supercharger geared for increased power ratings at low altitudes and the Merlin series that were designed to deliver increased power at high altitudes br While the design of the two stage supercharger forged ahead Rolls Royce also continued to develop the single stage supercharger resulting in in the development of a smaller cropped impeller for the Merlin M and M both of these engines developed greater power at low altitudes In squadron service the LF V variant of the Spitfire fitted with these engines became known as the clipped clapped and cropped Spitty to indicate the shortened wingspan the less than perfect condition of the used airframes and the cropped supercharger impeller br br br Carburettor developments br br The use of carburettors was calculated to give a higher specific power output due to the lower temperature hence greater density of the fuel air mixture compared to injected systems However the Merlin s float controlled carburettor meant that if Spitfires or Hurricanes were to pitch nose down into a steep dive negative g force g produced temporary fuel starvation causing the engine to cut out momentarily By comparison the contemporary Bf E which had direct fuel injection could bunt straight into a high power dive to escape attack RAF fighter pilots soon learned to avoid this with a half roll of their aircraft before diving in pursuit A restrictor in the fuel supply line together with a diaphragm fitted in the float chamber jocularly nicknamed Miss Shilling s orifice after its inventor went some way towards curing fuel starvation in a dive by containing fuel under negative G however at less than maximum power a fuel rich mixture still resulted Another improvement was made by moving the fuel outlet from the bottom of the S U carburettor to exactly halfway up the side which allowed the fuel to flow equally well under negative or positive g br Further improvements were introduced throughout the Merlin range saw the introduction of a Bendix Stromberg pressure carburettor that injected fuel at pounds per square inch kPa bar through a nozzle directly into the supercharger and was fitted to Merlin and variants The final development which was fitted to the series Merlins was an S U injection carburettor that injected fuel into the supercharger using a fuel pump driven as a function of crankshaft speed and engine pressures br br br Improved fuels br br At the start of the war the Merlin I II and III ran on the then standard octane aviation spirit and could generate just over hp kW from its litre cu in displacement the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using octane fuel was pounds per square inch kPa atm However as early as at the th Paris Air Show Rolls Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use octane fuel The Merlin R M M was capable of hp kW at feet m hp kW at feet m and hp kW on take off while a Merlin X with a two speed supercharger in high gear generated hp kW at feet m and hp kW at feet m br From late octane fuel became available from the U S West Indies Persia and in smaller quantities domestically consequently in the first half of the RAF transferred all Hurricane and Spitfire squadrons to octane fuel Small modifications were made to Merlin II and III series engines allowing an increased emergency boost pressure of pounds per square inch kPa atm At this power setting these engines were able to produce hp kW at ft m while running at revolutions per minute Increased boost could be used indefinitely as there was no mechanical time limit mechanism but pilots were advised not to use increased boost for more than a maximum of five minutes and it was considered a definite overload condition on the engine if the pilot resorted to emergency boost he had to report this on landing when it was noted in the engine log book while the engineering officer was required to examine the engine and reset the throttle gate Later versions of the Merlin ran only on octane fuel and the five minute combat limitation was raised to pounds per square inch kPa atm br In late trials were run of a new grade octane fuel recognised by its bright green colour and awful smell Initial tests were conducted using cubic centimetres imp fl oz of tetraethyllead T E L for every one imperial gallon of octane fuel or cc L or U S fl oz U S gal but this mixture resulted in a build up of lead in the combustion chambers causing excessive fouling of the spark plugs Better results were achieved by adding mono methyl aniline M M A to octane fuel The new fuel allowed the five minute boost rating of the Merlin to be raised to pounds per square inch kPa atm With this boost rating the Merlin generated hp kW at sea level and hp kW at ft m br Starting in March the Merlin powered Spitfire IXs of two Air Defence of Great Britain ADGB squadrons were cleared to use the new fuel for operational trials and it was put to good use in the summer of when it enabled Spitfire L F Mk IXs to intercept V flying bombs coming in at low altitudes grade fuel was also used by Mosquito night fighters of the ADGB to intercept V s In early February Spitfires of the Second Tactical Air Force TAF also began using grade fuel This fuel was also offered to the USAAF where it was designated PPF and informally known as Pep br br br Production br Production of the Rolls Royce Merlin was driven by the forethought and determination of Ernest Hives who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with the Air Ministry the Ministry of Aircraft Production and local authority officials Hives was an advocate of shadow factories and sensing the imminent outbreak of war pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force Despite the importance of uninterrupted production several factories were affected by industrial action By the end of its production run in Merlin engines had been built over in Britain and more than under licence in the U S br br br Derby br br The existing Rolls Royce facilities at Osmaston Derby were not suitable for mass engine production although the floor space had been increased by some between and Hives planned to build the first two or three hundred engines there until engineering teething troubles had been resolved To fund this expansion the Air Ministry had provided a total of by December Having a workforce that consisted mainly of design engineers and highly skilled men the Derby factory carried out the majority of development work on the Merlin with flight testing carried out at nearby RAF Hucknall All the Merlin engined aircraft taking part in the Battle of Britain had their engines assembled in the Derby factory Total Merlin production at Derby was The original factory closed in March but the company maintains a presence in Derby br br br Crewe br To meet the increasing demand for Merlin engines Rolls Royce started building work on a new factory at Crewe in May with engines leaving the factory in The Crewe factory had convenient road and rail links to their existing facilities at Derby Production at Crewe was originally planned to use unskilled labour and sub contractors with which Hives felt there would be no particular difficulty but the number of required sub contracted parts such as crankshafts camshafts and cylinder liners eventually fell short and the factory was expanded to manufacture these parts in house br Initially the local authority promised to build new houses to accommodate the workforce by the end of but by February it had only awarded a contract for Hives was incensed by this complacency and threatened to move the whole operation but timely intervention by the Air Ministry improved the situation In a strike took place when women replaced men on capstan lathes the workers union insisting this was a skilled labour job however the men returned to work after days br Total Merlin production at Crewe was br The factory was used postwar for the production of Rolls Royce and Bentley motor cars and military fighting vehicle power plants In Volkswagen AG bought the Bentley marque and the factory Today it is known as Bentley Crewe br br br Glasgow br br Hives further recommended that a factory be built near Glasgow to take advantage of the abundant local work force and the supply of steel and forgings from Scottish manufacturers In September the Air Ministry allocated for a new Shadow factory This government funded and operated factory was built at Hillington starting in June with workers moving into the premises in October one month after the outbreak of war The factory was fully occupied by September A housing crisis also occurred at Glasgow where Hives again asked the Air Ministry to step in br With employees the Glasgow factory was one of the largest industrial operations in Scotland Unlike the Derby and Crewe plants which relied significantly on external subcontractors it produced almost all the Merlin s components itself Hillingdon required a great deal of attention from Hives from when it was producing its first complete engine it had the highest proportion of unskilled workers in any Rolls Royce managed factory Engines began to leave the production line in November and by June monthly output had reached increasing to more than per month by March In total engines were produced Worker absenteeism became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of air raid shelters It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to hours a week with one half Sunday per month awarded as holiday Record production is reported to have been engines in one day br Immediately after the war the site repaired and overhauled Merlin and Griffon engines and continued to manufacture spare parts Finally following the production of the Rolls Royce Avon turbojet and others the factory was closed in br br br Manchester br br The Ford Motor Company was asked to produce Merlins at Trafford Park Stretford near Manchester and building work on a new factory was started in May on a acre ha site Built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage it was completed in May and bombed in the same month At first the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour and large numbers of women youths and untrained men had to be taken on Despite this the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month later and it was building the engine at a rate of per week by at which point the joint factories were producing Merlins per year In his autobiography Not much of an Engineer Sir Stanley Hooker states once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production Merlins came out like shelling peas br Some people worked at the Trafford Park plant including women and two resident doctors and nurses Merlin production started to run down in August and finally ceased on March br Total Merlin production at Trafford Park was br br br Packard V br br As the Merlin was considered to be so important to the war effort negotiations were started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK Rolls Royce staff visited North American automobile manufacturers to select one to build the Merlin in the U S or Canada Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U S in July and the Packard Motor Car Company was selected to take on the Merlin order equivalent to billion in dollars Agreement was reached in September and the first Packard built
