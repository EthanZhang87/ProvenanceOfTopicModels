id: 5704
A comic strip is a sequence of cartoons arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative often serialized with text in balloons and captions Traditionally throughout the th and into the st century these have been published in newspapers and magazines with daily horizontal strips printed in black and white in newspapers while Sunday papers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections With the advent of the internet online comic strips began to appear as webcomics br Most strips are written and drawn by a comics artist known as a cartoonist As the word comic implies strips are frequently humorous Examples of these gag a day strips are Blondie Bringing Up Father Marmaduke and Pearls Before Swine In the late s comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories as seen in Popeye Captain Easy Buck Rogers Tarzan and Terry and the Pirates In the s soap opera continuity strips such as Judge Parker and Mary Worth gained popularity Because comic strips are not always funny cartoonist Will Eisner has suggested that sequential art would be a better genre neutral name br Comic strips have appeared inside American magazines such as Liberty and Boys Life but also on the front covers such as the Flossy Frills series on The American Weekly Sunday newspaper supplement In the UK and the rest of Europe comic strips are also serialized in comic book magazines with a strip s story sometimes continuing over three pages br br br History br Storytelling using a sequence of pictures has existed through history One medieval European example in textile form is the Bayeux Tapestry Printed examples emerged in th century Germany and in mid th century England where some of the first satirical or humorous sequential narrative drawings were produced William Hogarth s th century English caricature include both narrative sequences such as A Rake s Progress and single panels br The Biblia pauperum Paupers Bible a tradition of picture Bibles beginning in the Late Middle Ages sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the miniatures written on scrolls coming out of their mouths which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips br In China with its traditions of block printing and of the incorporation of text with image experiments with what became lianhuanhua date back to br br The origin of the modern English language comic strip can be traced to the efflorescence of caricature in late th century London English caricaturists such as Richard Newton and George Woodward developed sophisticated caricature styles using strips of expressive comic figures with captions that could be read left to right to cumulative effect as well as business models for advertising and selling cheap comic illustration on regular subscription br Other leading British caricaturists produced strips as well for example James Gillray in Democracy or a Sketch of the Life of Buonaparte His contemporary Thomas Rowlandson used strips as early as for example in The Loves of the Fox and the Badger Rowlandson may also be credited with inventing the first internationally recognized comic strip character Doctor Syntax whose picaresque journeys through England were told through a series of comic etchings accompanied by verse Original published in parts between and in Rudolf Ackermann s Poetical Magazine in book form The Tour of Doctor Syntax in search of the picturesque ran to editions between and spun off two sequels a prequel numerous pirate imitations and copies including French German Danish and translations His image was available on pottery textiles wallpaper and other merchandise br br The Caricature Magazine or Hudibrastic Mirror an influential English comic series published in London between and by Thomas Tegg included some satirical stories in comic strip format such as The Adventures of Johnny Newcome br br br Newspapers br The first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late th century The Yellow Kid is usually credited as one of the first newspaper strips However the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip br The Glasgow Looking Glass was the first mass produced publication to tell stories using illustrations and is regarded as the world s first comic strip It satirised the political and social life of Scotland in the s It was conceived and illustrated by William Heath br Swiss author and caricature artist Rodolphe T pffer Geneva is considered the father of the modern comic strips His illustrated stories such as Histoire de Mr Vieux Bois first published in the US in as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck or Histoire de Monsieur Jabot inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists In German painter author and caricaturist Wilhelm Busch created the strip Max and Moritz about two trouble making boys which had a direct influence on the American comic strip Max and Moritz was a series of seven severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children s stories such as Struwwelpeter Shockheaded Peter In the story s final act the boys after perpetrating some mischief are tossed into a sack of grain run through a mill and consumed by a flock of geese without anybody mourning their demise Max and Moritz provided an inspiration for German immigrant Rudolph Dirks who created the Katzenjammer Kids in a strip starring two German American boys visually modelled on Max and Moritz Familiar comic strip iconography such as stars for pain sawing logs for snoring speech balloons and thought balloons originated in Dirks strip br Hugely popular Katzenjammer Kids occasioned one of the first comic strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium When Dirks left William Randolph Hearst for the promise of a better salary under Joseph Pulitzer it was an unusual move since cartoonists regularly deserted Pulitzer for Hearst In a highly unusual court decision Hearst retained the rights to the name Katzenjammer Kids while creator Dirks retained the rights to the characters Hearst promptly hired Harold Knerr to draw his own version of the strip Dirks renamed his version Hans and Fritz later The Captain and the Kids Thus two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the comics pages for decades Dirks version eventually distributed by United Feature Syndicate ran until br In the United States the great popularity of comics sprang from the newspaper war onwards between Pulitzer and Hearst The Little Bears was the first American comic strip with recurring characters while the first color comic supplement was published by the Chicago Inter Ocean sometime in the latter half of followed by the New York Journal s first color Sunday comic pages in On January Hearst introduced the nation s first full daily comic page in his New York Evening Journal The history of this newspaper rivalry and the rapid appearance of comic strips in most major American newspapers is discussed by Ian Gordon Numerous events in newspaper comic strips have reverberated throughout society at large though few of these events occurred in recent years owing mainly to the declining use of continuous storylines on newspaper comic strips which since the s had been waning as an entertainment form From to Gustave Verbeek wrote his comic series The UpsideDowns of Old Man Muffaroo and Little Lady Lovekins These comics were made in such a way that one could read the panel comic flip the book and keep reading He made such comics in total br The longest running American comic strips are br br The Katzenjammer Kids years br Gasoline Alley present br Ripley s Believe It or Not present br Barney Google and Snuffy Smith present br Thimble Theater Popeye present br Blondie present br Dick Tracy present br Alley Oop present br Bringing Up Father years br Little Orphan Annie years br Most newspaper comic strips are syndicated a syndicate hires people to write and draw a strip and then distributes it to many newspapers for a fee Some newspaper strips begin or remain exclusive to one newspaper For example the Pogo comic strip by Walt Kelly originally appeared only in the New York Star in and was not picked up for syndication until the following year br Newspaper comic strips come in two different types daily strips and Sunday strips In the United States a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays Monday through Saturday as contrasted with a Sunday strip which typically only appears on Sundays Daily strips usually are printed in black and white and Sunday strips are usually in color However a few newspapers have published daily strips in color and some newspapers have published Sunday strips in black and white br br br Popularity br br Making his first appearance in the British magazine Judy by writer and fledgling artist Charles H Ross in Ally Sloper is one of the earliest comic strip characters and he is regarded as the first recurring character in comics The highly popular character was spun off into his own comic Ally Sloper s Half Holiday in br While in the early th century comic strips were a frequent target for detractors of yellow journalism by the s the medium became wildly popular While radio and later television surpassed newspapers as a means of entertainment most comic strip characters were widely recognizable until the s and the funny pages were often arranged in a way they appeared at the front of Sunday editions In George Gallup s first poll had the comic section as the most important part of the newspaper with additional surveys pointing out that the comic strips were the second most popular feature after the picture page During the s many comic sections had between and pages although in some cases these had up to pages br The popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved authors including John Updike and Ray Bradbury have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips Often posted on bulletin boards clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed photocopied or mailed The Baltimore Sun s Linda White recalled I followed the adventures of Winnie Winkle Moon Mullins and Dondi and waited each fall to see how Lucy would manage to trick Charlie Brown into trying to kick that football After I left for college my father would clip out that strip each year and send it to me just to make sure I didn t miss it br br br Production and format br The two conventional formats for newspaper comics are strips and single gag panels The strips are usually displayed horizontally wider than they are tall Single panels are square circular or taller than they are wide Strips usually but not always are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel A horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag as seen occasionally in Mike Peters Mother Goose and Grimm br Early daily strips were large often running the entire width of the newspaper and were sometimes three or more inches high Initially a newspaper page included only a single daily strip usually either at the top or the bottom of the page By the s many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together During the s the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as inches wide by six inches high Over decades the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller until by four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip As strips have become smaller the number of panels have been reduced br Proof sheets were the means by which syndicates provided newspapers with black and white line art for the reproduction of strips which they arranged to have colored in the case of Sunday strips Michigan State University Comic Art Collection librarian Randy Scott describes these as large sheets of paper on which newspaper comics have traditionally been distributed to subscribing newspapers Typically each sheet will have either six daily strips of a given title or one Sunday strip Thus a week of Beetle Bailey would arrive at the Lansing State Journal in two sheets printed much larger than the final version and ready to be cut apart and fitted into the local comics page Comic strip historian Allan Holtz described how strips were provided as mats the plastic or cardboard trays in which molten metal is poured to make plates or even plates ready to be put directly on the printing press He also notes that with electronic means of distribution becoming more prevalent printed sheets are definitely on their way out br NEA Syndicate experimented briefly with a two tier daily strip Star Hawks but after a few years Star Hawks dropped down to a single tier br In Flanders the two tier strip is the standard publication style of most daily strips like Spike and Suzy and Nero They appear Monday through Saturday until there were no Sunday papers in Flanders In the last decades they have switched from black and white to color br br br Cartoon panels br br Single panels usually but not always are not broken up and lack continuity The daily Peanuts is a strip and the daily Dennis the Menace is a single panel J R Williams long run Out Our Way continued as a daily panel even after it expanded into a Sunday strip Out Our Way with the Willets Jimmy Hatlo s They ll Do It Every Time was often displayed in a two panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive pretentious unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation br br br Sunday comics br br Sunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section Early Sunday strips known colloquially as the funny papers shortened to the funnies such as Thimble Theatre and Little Orphan Annie filled an entire newspaper page a format known to collectors as full page Sunday pages during the s and into the s often carried a secondary strip by the same artist as the main strip No matter whether it appeared above or below a main strip the extra strip was known as the topper such as The Squirrel Cage which ran along with Room and Board both drawn by Gene Ahern br During the s the original art for a Sunday strip was usually drawn quite large For example in Russ Westover drew his Tillie the Toiler Sunday page at a size of In the cartoonist Dudley Fisher launched the innovative Right Around Home drawn as a huge single panel filling an entire Sunday page br Full page strips were eventually replaced by strips half that size Strips such as The Phantom and Terry and the Pirates began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full size newspapers such as the New Orleans Times Picayune or with one strip on a tabloid page as in the Chicago Sun Times When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged cropped or dropped panels During World War II because of paper shortages the size of Sunday strips began to shrink After the war strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs The last full page comic strip was the Prince Valiant strip for April br Comic strips have also been published in Sunday newspaper magazines Russell Patterson and Carolyn Wells New Adventures of Flossy Frills was a continuing strip series seen on Sunday magazine covers Beginning January it ran on the front covers of Hearst s American Weekly newspaper magazine supplement continuing until March of that year Between and four different stories featuring Flossy appeared on American Weekly covers br Sunday comics sections employed offset color printing with multiple print runs imitating a wide range of colors Printing plates were created with four or more colors traditionally the CMYK color model cyan magenta yellow and K for black With a screen of tiny dots on each printing plate the dots allowed an image to be printed in a halftone that appears to the eye in different gradations The semi opaque property of ink allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full color imagery br br br Underground comic strips br The decade of the s saw the rise of underground newspapers which often carried comic strips such as Fritz the Cat and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers Zippy the Pinhead initially appeared in underground publications in the s before being syndicated Bloom County and Doonesbury began as strips in college newspapers under different titles and later moved to national syndication Underground comic strips covered subjects that are usually taboo in newspaper strips such as sex and drugs Many underground artists notably Vaughn Bode Dan O Neill Gilbert Shelton and Art Spiegelman went on to draw comic strips for magazines such as Playboy National Lampoon and Pete Millar s CARtoons Jay Lynch graduated from undergrounds to alternative weekly newspapers to Mad and children s books br br br Webcomics br br Webcomics also known as online comics and internet comics are comics that are available to read on the Internet Many are exclusively published online but the majority of traditional newspaper comic strips have some Internet presence King Features Syndicate and other syndicates often provide archives of recent strips on their websites Some such as Scott Adams creator of Dilbert include an email address in each strip br br br Conventions and genres br br Most comic strip characters do not age throughout the strip s life but in some strips like Lynn Johnston s award winning For Better or For Worse the characters age as the years pass The first strip to feature aging characters was Gasoline Alley br The history of comic strips also includes series that are not humorous but tell an ongoing dramatic story Examples include The Phantom Prince Valiant Dick Tracy Mary Worth Modesty Blaise Little Orphan Annie Flash Gordon and Tarzan Sometimes these are spin offs from comic books for example Superman Batman and The Amazing Spider Man br A number of strips have featured animals as main characters Some are non verbal Marmaduke The Angriest Dog in the World some have verbal thoughts but are not understood by humans Garfield Snoopy in Peanuts and some can converse with humans Bloom County Calvin and Hobbes Mutts Citizen Dog Buckles Get Fuzzy Pearls Before Swine and Pooch Cafe Other strips are centered entirely on animals as in Pogo and Donald Duck Gary Larson s The Far Side was unusual as there were no central characters Instead The Far Side used a wide variety of characters including humans monsters aliens chickens cows worms amoebas and more John McPherson s Close to Home also uses this theme though the characters are mostly restricted to humans and real life situations Wiley Miller not only mixes human animal and fantasy characters but also does several different comic strip continuities under one umbrella title Non Sequitur Bob Thaves s Frank Ernest began in and paved the way for some of these strips as its human characters were manifest in diverse forms as animals vegetables and minerals br br br Social and political influence br The comics have long held a distorted mirror to contemporary society and almost from the beginning have been used for political or social commentary This ranged from the conservative slant of Harold Gray s Little Orphan Annie to the unabashed liberalism of Garry Trudeau s Doonesbury Al Capp s Li l Abner espoused liberal opinions for most of its run but by the late s it became a mouthpiece for Capp s repudiation of the counterculture br Pogo used animals to particularly devastating effect caricaturing many prominent politicians of the day as animal denizens of Pogo s Okeefenokee Swamp In a fearless move Pogo s creator Walt Kelly took on Joseph McCarthy in the s caricaturing him as a bobcat named Simple J Malarkey a megalomaniac who was bent on taking over the characters birdwatching club and rooting out all undesirables Kelly also defended the medium against possible government regulation in the McCarthy era At a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual violent and subversive content Kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips Going before the Congressional subcommittee he proceeded to charm the members with his drawings and the force of his personality The comic strip was safe for satire br During the early th century comic strips were widely associated with publisher William Randolph Hearst whose papers had the largest circulation of strips in the United States Hearst was notorious for his practice of yellow journalism and he was frowned on by readers of The New York Times and other newspapers which featured few or no comic strips Hearst s critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views Hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists most notably his continued support of George Herriman s Krazy Kat An inspiration for Bill Watterson and other cartoonists Krazy Kat gained a considerable following among intellectuals during the s and s br Some comic strips such as Doonesbury and Mallard Fillmore may be printed on the editorial or op ed page rather than the comics page because of their regular political commentary For example the August Doonesbury strip was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for its depiction of the Watergate scandal Dilbert is sometimes found in the business section of a newspaper instead of the comics page because of the strip s commentary about office politics and Tank McNamara often appears on the sports page because of its subject matter Lynn Johnston s For Better or For Worse created an uproar when Lawrence one of the strip s supporting characters came out of the closet br br br Publicity and recognition br The world s longest comic strip is metre ft long and on display at Trafalgar Square as part of the London Comedy Festival The London Cartoon Strip was created by of Britain s best known cartoonists and depicts the history of London br The Reuben named for cartoonist Rube Goldberg is the most prestigious award for U S comic strip artists Reuben awards are presented annually by the National Cartoonists Society NCS br In the United States Postal Service issued a series of commemorative stamps Comic Strip Classics marking the comic strip centennial br Today s strip artists with the help of the NCS enthusiastically promote the medium which since the s and particularly the s has been considered to be in decline due to numerous factors such as changing tastes in humor and entertainment the waning relevance of newspapers in general and the loss of most foreign markets outside English speaking countries One particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the Great Comic Strip Switcheroonie held in on April Fool s Day an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other s strips Garfield s Jim Davis for example switched with Blondie s Stan Drake while Scott Adams Dilbert traded strips with Bil Keane The Family Circus br While the Switcheroonie was a one time publicity stunt an artist taking over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning as it is in the comic book industry In fact the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre s more popular strips Examples include Little Orphan Annie drawn and plotted by Harold Gray from to and thereafter by a succession of artists including Leonard Starr and Andrew Pepoy and Terry and the Pirates started by Milton Caniff in and picked up by George Wunder br A business driven variation has sometimes led to the same feature continuing under a different name In one case in the early s Don Flowers Modest Maidens was so admired by William Randolph Hearst that he lured Flowers away from the Associated Press and to King Features Syndicate by doubling the cartoonist s salary and renamed the feature Glamor Girls to avoid legal action by the AP The latter continued to publish Modest Maidens drawn by Jay Allen in Flowers style br br br Issues in U S newspaper comic strips br As newspapers have declined the changes have affected comic strips Jeff Reece lifestyle editor of The Florida Times Union wrote Comics are sort of the third rail of the newspaper br br br Size br In the early decades of the th century all Sunday comics received a full page and daily strips were generally the width of the page The competition between papers for having more cartoons than the rest from the mid s the growth of large scale newspaper advertising during most of the thirties paper rationing during World War II the decline on news readership as television newscasts began to be more common and inflation which has caused higher printing costs beginning during the fifties and sixties led to Sunday strips being published on smaller and more diverse formats As newspapers have reduced the page count of Sunday comic sections since the late s by the s most sections have only four pages with the back page not always being destined for comics has also led to further downsizes br Daily strips have suffered as well Before the mid s there was not a standard size with strips running the entire width of a page or having more than one tier By the s strips often covered six of the eight columns occupied by a traditional broadsheet paper During the s strips were reduced to four columns wide with a transition width of five columns As newspapers became narrower beginning in the s strips have gotten even smaller often being just three columns wide a similar width to the one most daily panels occupied before the s br In an issue related to size limitations Sunday comics are often bound to rigid formats that allow their panels to be rearranged in several different ways while remaining readable Such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning which some newspapers will omit for space As a result cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels Garfield and Mutts were known during the mid to late s and s respectively for their throwaways on their Sunday strips however both strips now run generic title panels br Some cartoonists have complained about this with Walt Kelly creator of Pogo openly voicing his discontent about being forced to draw his Sunday strips in such rigid formats from the beginning Kelly s heirs opted to end the strip in as a form of protest against the practice Since then Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson has written extensively on the issue arguing that size reduction and dropped panels reduce both the potential and freedom of a cartoonist After a lengthy battle with his syndicate Watterson won the privilege of making half page sized Sunday strips where he could arrange the panels any way he liked Many newspaper publishers and a few cartoonists objected to this and some papers continued to print Calvin and Hobbes at small sizes Opus won that same privilege years after Calvin and Hobbes ended while Wiley Miller circumvented further downsizes by making his Non Sequitur Sunday strip available only in a vertical arrangement Most strips created since however are drawn in the unbroken third page format Few newspapers still run half page strips as with Prince Valiant and H gar the Horrible in the front page of the Reading Eagle Sunday comics section until the mid s br br br Format br With the success of The Gumps during the s it became commonplace for strips comedy and adventure laden alike to have lengthy stories spanning weeks or months The Monarch of Medioka story in Floyd Gottfredson s Mickey Mouse comic strip ran from September to May Between the s and the late s as television news relegated newspaper reading to an occasional basis rather than daily syndicators were abandoning long stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags or week long storylines with six consecutive mostly unrelated strips following a same subject with longer storylines being used mainly on adventure based and dramatic strips Strips begun during the mid s or after such as Get Fuzzy Over the Hedge Monty and others are known for their heavy use of storylines lasting between one and three weeks in most cases br The writing style of comic strips changed as well after World War II With an increase in the number of college educated readers there was a shift away from slapstick comedy and towards more cerebral humor Slapstick and visual gags became more confined to Sunday strips because as Garfield creator Jim Davis put it Children are more likely to read Sunday strips than dailies br br br Second author br Many older strips are no longer drawn by the original cartoonist who has either died or retired Such strips are known as zombie strips A cartoonist paid by the syndicate or sometimes a relative of the original cartoonist continues writing the strip a tradition that became commonplace in the early half of the th century H gar the Horrible and Frank and Ernest are both drawn by the sons of the creators Some strips which are still in affiliation with the original creator are produced by small teams or entire companies such as Jim Davis Garfield however there is some debate if these strips fall in this category br This act is commonly criticized by modern cartoonists including Watterson and Pearls Before Swine s Stephan Pastis The issue was addressed in six consecutive Pearls strips in Charles Schulz of Peanuts fame requested that his strip not be continued by another cartoonist after his death He also rejected the idea of hiring an inker or letterer comparing it to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts Schulz s family has honored his wishes and refused numerous proposals by syndicators to continue Peanuts with a new author br br br Assistants br Since the consolidation of newspaper comics by the first quarter of the th century most cartoonists have used a group of assistants with usually one of them credited However quite a few cartoonists e g George Herriman and Charles Schulz among others have done their strips almost completely by themselves often criticizing the use of assistants for the same reasons most have about their editors hiring anyone else to continue their work after their retirement br br br Rights to the strips br Historically syndicates owned the creators work enabling them to continue publishing the strip after the original creator retired left the strip or died This practice led to the term legacy strips or more pejoratively zombie strips Most syndicates signed creators to or even year contracts There have been exceptions however such as Bud Fisher s Mutt and Jeff being an early if not the earliest case in which the creator retained ownership of his work Both these practices began to change with the debut of Universal Press Syndicate as the company gave cartoonists a percent ownership share of their work Creators Syndicate founded in granted artists full rights to the strips something that Universal Press did in followed by King Features in By both Tribune Media Services and United Feature had begun granting ownership rights to creators limited to new and or hugely popular strips br br br Censorship br Starting in the late s the national syndicates which distributed newspaper comic strips subjected them to very strict censorship Li l Abner was censored in September and was pulled from the Pittsburgh Press by Scripps Howard The controversy as reported in Time centered on Capp s portrayal of the U S Senate Said Edward Leech of Scripps We don t think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks boobs and undesirables br As comics are easier for children to access compared to other types of media they have a significantly more rigid censorship code than other media Stephan Pastis has lamented that the unwritten censorship code is still stuck somewhere in the s Generally comics are not allowed to include such words as damn sucks screwed and hell although there have been exceptions such as the September Mother Goose and Grimm in which an elderly man says This nursing home food sucks and a pair of Pearls Before Swine comics from January with a character named Ned using the word crappy Naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown according to Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams Such comic strip taboos were detailed in Dave Breger s book But That s Unprintable Bantam br Many issues such as sex narcotics and terrorism cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips although there are exceptions usually for satire as in Bloom County This led some cartoonists to resort to double entendre or dialogue children do not understand as in Greg Evans Luann Another example of wordplay to get around censorship is a July Pearls Before Swine strip that features Pig talking to his sister and says the phrase I SIS repeatedly after correcting his sister s grammar The strip then cuts to a scene of a NSA wiretap agent following a scene of Pig being arrested by the FBI saying Never correct your sister s grammar implying that the CIA mistook the phrase I SIS with ISIS Younger cartoonists have claimed commonplace words images and issues should be allowed in the comics considering that the pressure on clean humor has been a chief factor for the declining popularity of comic strips since the s Aaron McGruder creator of The Boondocks decided to end his strip partly because of censorship issues while the Popeye daily comic strip ended in after newspapers objected to a storyline they considered to be a satire on abortion Some of the taboo words and topics are mentioned daily on television and other forms of visual media Webcomics and comics distributed primarily to college newspapers are much freer in this respect br br br See also br br Biblia pauperum br Billy Ireland
