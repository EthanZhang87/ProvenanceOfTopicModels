Spanish espa ol or Castilian castellano is a Romance language of the Indo European language family that evolved from the Vulgar Latin spoken on the Iberian Peninsula of Europe Today it is a global language with about million native speakers mainly in the Americas and Spain and about million when including second language speakers Spanish is the official language of countries as well as one of the six official languages of the United Nations Spanish is the world s second most spoken native language after Mandarin Chinese the world s fourth most spoken language overall after English Mandarin Chinese and Hindustani Hindi Urdu and the world s most widely spoken Romance language The country with the largest population of native speakers is Mexico br Spanish is part of the Ibero Romance language group in which the language is also known as Castilian castellano The group evolved from several dialects of Vulgar Latin in Iberia after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the th century The oldest Latin texts with traces of Spanish come from mid northern Iberia in the th century and the first systematic written use of the language happened in Toledo a prominent city of the Kingdom of Castile in the th century Spanish colonialism in the early modern period spurred the introduction of the language to overseas locations most notably to the Americas br As a Romance language Spanish is a descendant of Latin Around of modern Spanish vocabulary is Latin in origin including Latin borrowings from Ancient Greek Alongside English and French it is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world Spanish is well represented in the humanities and social sciences Spanish is also the third most used language on the internet by number of users after English and Chinese and the second most used language by number of websites after English br Spanish is used as an official language by many international organizations including the United Nations European Union Organization of American States Union of South American Nations Community of Latin American and Caribbean States African Union among others br br br Name of the language and etymology br br br Name of the language br In Spain and some other parts of the Spanish speaking world Spanish is called not only espa ol but also castellano Castilian the language from the Kingdom of Castile contrasting it with other languages spoken in Spain such as Galician Basque Asturian Catalan Valencian Aragonese Occitan and other minor languages br The Spanish Constitution of uses the term castellano to define the official language of the whole of Spain in contrast to las dem s lenguas espa olas lit the other Spanish languages Article III reads as follows br br El castellano es la lengua espa ola oficial del Estado Las dem s lenguas espa olas ser n tambi n oficiales en las respectivas Comunidades Aut nomas br Castilian is the official Spanish language of the State The other Spanish languages shall also be official in their respective Autonomous Communities br The Royal Spanish Academy Real Academia Espa ola on the other hand currently uses the term espa ol in its publications However from to it called the language castellano br The Diccionario panhisp nico de dudas a language guide published by the Royal Spanish Academy states that although the Royal Spanish Academy prefers to use the term espa ol in its publications when referring to the Spanish language both terms espa ol and castellano are regarded as synonymous and equally valid br br br Etymology br The term castellano is related to Castile Castilla or archaically Castiella the kingdom where the language was originally spoken The name Castile in turn is usually assumed to be derived from castillo castle br In the Middle Ages the language spoken in Castile was generically referred to as Romance and later also as Lengua vulgar Later in the period it gained geographical specification as Romance castellano romanz castellano romanz de Castiella lenguaje de Castiella and ultimately simply as castellano noun br Different etymologies have been suggested for the term espa ol Spanish According to the Royal Spanish Academy espa ol derives from the Occitan word espaignol and that in turn derives from the Vulgar Latin hispaniolus of Hispania Hispania was the Roman name for the entire Iberian Peninsula br There are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy Spanish philologist Ram n Men ndez Pidal suggested that the classic hispanus or hispanicus took the suffix one from Vulgar Latin as happened with other words such as bret n Breton or saj n Saxon br br br History br br Like the other Romance languages the Spanish language evolved from Vulgar Latin which was brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Romans during the Second Punic War beginning in BC Several pre Roman languages also called Paleohispanic languages some distantly related to Latin as Indo European languages and some that are not related at all were previously spoken in the Iberian Peninsula These languages included Proto Basque Iberian Lusitanian Celtiberian and Gallaecian br The first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the th century Throughout the Middle Ages and into the modern era the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring Romance languages Mozarabic Andalusi Romance Navarro Aragonese Leonese Catalan Valencian Portuguese Galician Occitan and later French and Italian Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from Arabic as well as a minor influence from the Germanic Gothic language through the migration of tribes and a period of Visigoth rule in Iberia In addition many more words were borrowed from Latin through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church The loanwords were taken from both Classical Latin and Renaissance Latin the form of Latin in use at that time br According to the theories of Ram n Men ndez Pidal local sociolects of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish in the north of Iberia in an area centered in the city of Burgos and this dialect was later brought to the city of Toledo where the written standard of Spanish was first developed in the th century In this formative stage Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin Leonese and according to some authors was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence see Iberian Romance languages This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the Reconquista and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the Arabic of Al Andalus much of it indirectly through the Romance Mozarabic dialects some Arabic derived words make up around of the language today The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of Toledo in the th to th centuries and Madrid from the s br The development of the Spanish sound system from that of Vulgar Latin exhibits most of the changes that are typical of Western Romance languages including lenition of intervocalic consonants thus Latin v ta Spanish vida The diphthongization of Latin stressed short e and o which occurred in open syllables in French and Italian but not at all in Catalan or Portuguese is found in both open and closed syllables in Spanish as shown in the following table br br Spanish is marked by palatalization of the Latin double consonants geminates nn and ll thus Latin br annum Spanish a o and Latin anellum Spanish br anillo br The consonant written u or v in Latin and pronounced w in Classical Latin had probably fortified to a bilabial fricative in Vulgar Latin In early Spanish but not in Catalan or Portuguese it merged with the consonant written b a bilabial with plosive and fricative allophones In modern Spanish there is no difference between the pronunciation of orthographic b and v br Typical of Spanish as also of neighboring Gascon extending as far north as the Gironde estuary and found in a small area of Calabria attributed by some scholars to a Basque substratum was the mutation of Latin initial f into h whenever it was followed by a vowel that did not diphthongize The h still preserved in spelling is now silent in most varieties of the language although in some Andalusian and Caribbean dialects it is still aspirated in some words Because of borrowings from Latin and neighboring Romance languages there are many f h doublets in modern Spanish Fernando and Hernando both Spanish for Ferdinand ferrero and herrero both Spanish for smith fierro and hierro both Spanish for iron and fondo and hondo both words pertaining to depth in Spanish though fondo means bottom while hondo means deep additionally hacer to make is cognate to the root word of satisfacer to satisfy and hecho made is similarly cognate to the root word of satisfecho satisfied br Compare the examples in the following table br br Some consonant clusters of Latin also produced characteristically different results in these languages as shown in the examples in the following table br br In the th and th centuries Spanish underwent a dramatic change in the pronunciation of its sibilant consonants known in Spanish as the reajuste de las sibilantes which resulted in the distinctive velar x pronunciation of the letter j and in a large part of Spain the characteristic interdental th sound for the letter z and for c before e or i See History of Spanish Modern development of the Old Spanish sibilants for details br The Gram tica de la lengua castellana written in Salamanca in by Elio Antonio de Nebrija was the first grammar written for a modern European language According to a popular anecdote when Nebrija presented it to Queen Isabella I she asked him what was the use of such a work and he answered that language is the instrument of empire In his introduction to the grammar dated August Nebrija wrote that language was always the companion of empire br From the th century onwards the language was taken to the Spanish discovered America and the Spanish East Indies via Spanish colonization of America Miguel de Cervantes author of Don Quixote is such a well known reference in the world that Spanish is often called la lengua de Cervantes the language of Cervantes br In the th century Spanish was introduced to Equatorial Guinea and the Western Sahara and to areas of the United States that had not been part of the Spanish Empire such as Spanish Harlem in New York City For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish see Influences on the Spanish language br br br Geographical distribution br br Spanish is the primary language in countries worldwide As of it is estimated that about million people speak Spanish as a native language making it the second most spoken language by number of native speakers An additional million speak Spanish as a second or foreign language making it the fourth most spoken language in the world overall after English Mandarin Chinese and Hindi with a total number of million speakers Spanish is also the third most used language on the Internet after English and Chinese br br br Europe br br Spanish is the official language of Spain Upon the emergence of the Castilian Crown as the dominant power in the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the Middle Ages the Romance vernacular associated with this polity became increasingly used in instances of prestige and influence and the distinction between Castilian and Spanish started to become blurred Hard policies imposing the language s hegemony in an intensely centralising Spanish state were established from the th century onward br Other European territories in which it is also widely spoken include Gibraltar and Andorra br Spanish is also spoken by immigrant communities in other European countries such as the United Kingdom France Italy and Germany Spanish is an official language of the European Union br br br Americas br br br Hispanic America br br Today the majority of the Spanish speakers live in Hispanic America Nationally Spanish is the official language either de facto or de jure of Argentina Bolivia co official with indigenous languages Chile Colombia Costa Rica Cuba Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Mexico co official with indigenous languages Nicaragua Panama Paraguay co official with Guaran Peru co official with Quechua Aymara and the other indigenous languages Puerto Rico co official with English Uruguay and Venezuela br br br United States br br Spanish language has a long history in the territory of the current day United States dating back to the th century In the wake of the Guadalupe Hidalgo Treaty hundreds of thousands of Spanish speakers became a minoritized community in the United States The th century saw further massive growth of Spanish speakers in areas where they had been hitherto scarce br According to the census over million people of the U S population were of Hispanic or Hispanic American by origin In turn million people in the United States aged five or older speak Spanish at home or about of the population Spanish predominates in the unincorporated territory of Puerto Rico where it is also an official language along with English br Spanish is by far the most common second language in the country with over million total speakers if non native or second language speakers are included While English is the de facto national language of the country Spanish is often used in public services and notices at the federal and state levels Spanish is also used in administration in the state of New Mexico The language has a strong influence in major metropolitan areas such as those of Los Angeles Miami San Antonio New York San Francisco Dallas Tucson and Phoenix of the Arizona Sun Corridor as well as more recently Chicago Las Vegas Boston Denver Houston Indianapolis Philadelphia Cleveland Salt Lake City Atlanta Nashville Orlando Tampa Raleigh and Baltimore Washington D C due to th and st century immigration br br br Rest of the Americas br Although Spanish has no official recognition in the former British colony of Belize known until as British Honduras where English is the sole official language according to the census it was then spoken natively by of the population and of the total population were able to speak the language br Due to its proximity to Spanish speaking countries and small existing native Spanish speaking minority Trinidad and Tobago has implemented Spanish language teaching into its education system The Trinidadian and Tobagonian government launched the Spanish as a First Foreign Language SAFFL initiative in March br In addition to sharing most of its borders with Spanish speaking countries the creation of Mercosur in the early s induced a favorable situation for the promotion of Spanish language teaching in Brazil In the National Congress of Brazil approved a bill signed into law by the President making it mandatory for schools to offer Spanish as an alternative foreign language course in both public and private secondary schools in Brazil In September this law was revoked by Michel Temer after the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff In many border towns and villages along Paraguay and Uruguay a mixed language known as Portu ol is spoken br br br Africa br br br Sub Saharan Africa br br Equatorial Guinea is the only Spanish speaking country located entirely in Africa with the language introduced during the Spanish colonial period Enshrined in the constitution as an official language alongside French and Portuguese Spanish features prominently in the Equatoguinean education system and is the primary language used in government and business Whereas it is not the mother tongue of virtually any of its speakers the vast majority of the population is proficient in Spanish The Instituto Cervantes estimates that of the population is fluent in Spanish The proportion of proficient Spanish speakers in Equatorial Guinea exceeds the proportion of proficient speakers in other West and Central African nations of their respective colonial languages br Spanish is spoken by very small communities in Angola due to Cuban influence from the Cold War and in South Sudan among South Sudanese natives that relocated to Cuba during the Sudanese wars and returned for their country s independence br br br North Africa and Macaronesia br br Spanish is also spoken in the integral territories of Spain in Africa namely the cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the Canary Islands located in the Atlantic Ocean some km mi off the northwest of the African mainland The Spanish spoken in the Canary Islands traces its origins back to the Castilian conquest in the th century and in addition to a resemblance to Western Andalusian speech patterns it also features strong influence from the Spanish varieties spoken in the Americas which in turn have also been influenced historically by Canarian Spanish The Spanish spoken in North Africa by native bilingual speakers of Arabic or Berber who also speak Spanish as a second language features characteristics involving the variability of the vowel system br While far from its heyday during the Spanish protectorate in Morocco the Spanish language has some presence in northern Morocco stemming for example from the availability of certain Spanish language media According to a survey by Morocco s Royal Institute for Strategic Studies IRES penetration of Spanish in Morocco reaches of the population Many northern Moroccans have rudimentary knowledge of Spanish with Spanish being particularly significant in areas adjacent to Ceuta and Melilla Spanish also has a presence in the education system of the country through either selected education centers implementing Spain s education system primarily located in the North or the availability of Spanish as foreign language subject in secondary education br In Western Sahara formerly Spanish Sahara a primarily Hassaniya Arabic speaking territory Spanish was officially spoken as the language of the colonial administration during the late th and th centuries Today Spanish is present in the partially recognized Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic as its secondary official language and in the Sahrawi refugee camps in Tindouf Algeria where the Spanish language is still taught as a second language largely by Cuban educators The number of Spanish speakers is unknown br Spanish is also an official language of the African Union br br br Asia br br Spanish was an official language of the Philippines from the beginning of Spanish administration in to a constitutional change in During Spanish colonization it was the language of government trade and education and was spoken as a first language by Spaniards and educated Filipinos Ilustrados Despite a public education system set up by the colonial government by the end of Spanish rule in only about of the population had knowledge of Spanish mostly those of Spanish descent or elite standing br Spanish continued to be official and used in Philippine literature and press during the early years of American administration after the Spanish American War but was eventually replaced by English as the primary language of administration and education by the s Nevertheless despite a significant decrease in influence and speakers Spanish remained an official language of the Philippines upon independence in alongside English and Filipino a standardized version of Tagalog br Spanish was briefly removed from official status in but reimplemented under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos two months later It remained an official language until the ratification of the present constitution in in which it was re designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language Additionally the constitution in its Article XIV stipulates that the Government shall provide the people of the Philippines with a Spanish language translation of the country s constitution In recent years changing attitudes among non Spanish speaking Filipinos have helped spur a revival of the language and starting in Spanish was reintroduced as part of the basic education curriculum in a number of public high schools becoming the largest foreign language program offered by the public school system with over students studying the language in the school year alone The local business process outsourcing industry has also helped boost the language s economic prospects Today while the actual number of proficient Spanish speakers is around or under of the population a new generation of Spanish speakers in the Philippines has likewise emerged though speaker estimates vary widely br Aside from standard Spanish a Spanish based creole language called Chavacano developed in the southern Philippines However it is not mutually intelligible with Spanish The number of Chavacano speakers was estimated at million in The local languages of the Philippines also retain significant Spanish influence with many words derived from Mexican Spanish owing to the administration of the islands by Spain through New Spain until until direct governance from Madrid afterwards to br br br Oceania br br Spanish is the official and most spoken language on Easter Island which is geographically part of Polynesia in Oceania and politically part of Chile However Easter Island s traditional language is Rapa Nui an Eastern Polynesian language br As a legacy of comprising the former Spanish East Indies Spanish loan words are present in the local languages of Guam Northern Mariana Islands Palau Marshall Islands and Micronesia br In addition in Australia and New Zealand there are native Spanish communities resulting from emigration from Spanish speaking countries mainly from the Southern Cone br br br Spanish speakers by country br countries and one United States territory speak Spanish officially and the language has a significant unofficial presence in the rest of the United States along with Andorra Belize and the territory of Gibraltar br br br Grammar br br Most of the grammatical and typological features of Spanish are shared with the other Romance languages Spanish is a fusional language The noun and adjective systems exhibit two genders and two numbers In addition articles and some pronouns and determiners have a neuter gender in their singular form There are about fifty conjugated forms per verb with tenses past present future aspects for past perfective imperfective moods indicative subjunctive conditional imperative persons first second third numbers singular plural verboid forms infinitive gerund and past participle The indicative mood is the unmarked one while the subjunctive mood expresses uncertainty or indetermination and is commonly paired with the conditional which is a mood used to express would as in I would eat if I had food the imperative is a mood to express a command commonly a one word phrase Di Talk br Verbs express T V distinction by using different persons for formal and informal addresses For a detailed overview of verbs see Spanish verbs and Spanish irregular verbs br Spanish syntax is considered right branching meaning that subordinate or modifying constituents tend to be placed after head words The language uses prepositions rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for case and usually though not always places adjectives after nouns as do most other Romance languages br Spanish is classified as a subject verb object language however as in most Romance languages constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by topicalization and focus rather than by syntax It is a pro drop or null subject language that is it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are pragmatically unnecessary Spanish is described as a verb framed language meaning that the direction of motion is expressed in the verb while the mode of locomotion is expressed adverbially e g subir corriendo or salir volando the respective English equivalents of these examples to run up and to fly out show that English is by contrast satellite framed with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier br br br Phonology br br The Spanish phonological system evolved from that of Vulgar Latin Its development exhibits some traits in common with other Western Romance languages others with the neighboring Hispanic varieties especially Leonese and Aragonese as well as other features unique to Spanish Spanish is alone among its immediate neighbors in having undergone frequent aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial f sound e g Cast harina vs Leon and Arag farina The Latin initial consonant sequences pl cl and fl in Spanish typically merge as ll originally pronounced while in Aragonese they are preserved in most dialects and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes including t and Where Latin had li before a vowel e g filius or the ending iculus icula e g auricula Old Spanish produced that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative x hijo oreja whereas neighboring languages have the palatal lateral e g Portuguese filho orelha Catalan fill orella br br br Segmental phonology br br The Spanish phonemic inventory consists of five vowel phonemes a e i o u and to consonant phonemes the exact number depending on the dialect The main allophonic variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels i and u to glides j and w respectively when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel Some instances of the mid vowels e and o determined lexically alternate with the diphthongs je and we respectively when stressed in a process that is better described as morphophonemic rather than phonological as it is not predictable from phonology alone br The Spanish consonant system is characterized by three nasal phonemes and one or two depending on the dialect lateral phoneme s which in syllable final position lose their contrast and are subject to assimilation to a following consonant three voiceless stops and the affricate t three or four depending on the dialect voiceless fricatives a set of voiced obstruents b d and sometimes which alternate between approximant and plosive allophones depending on the environment and a phonemic distinction between the tapped and trilled r sounds single r and double rr in orthography br In the following table of consonant phonemes is marked with an asterisk to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects In most dialects it has been merged with in the merger called ye smo Similarly is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from s see seseo although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain br The phoneme is in parentheses to indicate that it appears only in loanwords Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes b d and appears to the right of a pair of voiceless phonemes to indicate that while the voiceless phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive or affricate and fricative the voiced ones alternate allophonically i e without phonemic contrast between plosive and approximant pronunciations br br br Prosody br Spanish is classified by its rhythm as a syllable timed language each syllable has approximately the same duration regardless of stress br Spanish intonation varies significantly according to dialect but generally conforms to a pattern of falling tone for declarative sentences and wh questions who what why etc and rising tone for yes no questions There are no syntactic markers to distinguish between questions and statements and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative depends entirely on intonation br Stress most often occurs on any of the last three syllables of a word with some rare exceptions at the fourth to last or earlier syllables Stress tends to occur as follows br br in words that end with a monophthong on the penultimate syllable br when the word ends in a diphthong on the final syllable br in words that end with a consonant on the last syllable with the exception of two grammatical endings n for third person plural of verbs and s for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second person singular of verbs However even though a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with n are also stressed on the penult joven virgen mitin the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with n are stressed on their last syllable capit n almac n jard n coraz n br Preantepenultimate stress stress on the fourth to last syllable occurs rarely only on verbs with clitic pronouns attached e g guard ndoselos saving them for him her them you br In addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies there are numerous minimal pairs that contrast solely on stress such as s bana sheet and sabana savannah l mite boundary limite he she limits and limit I limited l quido liquid liquido I sell off and liquid he she sold off br The orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs in the absence of an accent mark the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is n s or a vowel in which cases the stress falls on the next to last penultimate syllable Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable See Spanish orthography br br br Speaker population br Spanish is the official or national language in countries and one territory in the Americas Spain and Equatorial Guinea With a population of over million Hispanophone America accounts for the vast majority of Spanish speakers of which Mexico is the most populous Spanish speaking country In the European Union Spanish is the mother tongue of of the population with an additional speaking it as a second language Additionally Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States and is by far the most popular foreign language among students In it was estimated that over million Americans spoke Spanish about million of whom were native speakers With continued immigration and increased use of the language domestically in public spheres and media the number of Spanish speakers in the United States is expected to continue growing over the forthcoming decades br br br Dialectal variation br br While being mutually intelligible there are important variations phonological grammatical and lexical in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish speaking areas of the Americas br The national variety with the most speakers is Mexican Spanish It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world s Spanish speakers more than million of the total of more than million according to the table above One of its main features is the reduction or loss of unstressed vowels mainly when they are in contact with the sound s br In Spain northern dialects are popularly thought of as closer to the standard although positive attitudes toward southern dialects have increased significantly in the last years The speech from the educated classes of Madrid is the standard variety for use on radio and television in Spain and it is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish Central European Spanish speech patterns have been noted to be in the process of merging with more innovative southern varieties including Eastern Andalusian and Murcian as an emerging interdialectal levelled koine buffered between the Madrid s traditional national standard and the Seville speech trends br br br Phonology br br The four main phonological divisions are based respectively on the phoneme the debuccalization of syllable final s the sound of the spelled s and the phoneme br br The phoneme spelled c before e or i and spelled z elsewhere a voiceless dental fricative as in English thing is maintained by a majority of Spain s population especially in the northern and central parts of the country In other areas some parts of southern Spain the Canary Islands and the Americas does not exist and s occurs instead The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called distinci n in Spanish while the merger is generally called seseo in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as s or occasionally ceceo referring to its interdental realization in some parts of southern Spain In most of Hispanic America the spelled c before e or i and spelled z is always pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant br The debuccalization pronunciation as h or loss of syllable final s is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas Central America except central Costa Rica and Guatemala the Caribbean coastal areas of southern Mexico and South America except Andean highlands Debuccalization is frequently called aspiration in English and aspiraci n in Spanish When there is no debuccalization the syllable final s is pronounced as voiceless apico alveolar sibilant or as a voiceless dental sibilant in the same fashion as in the next paragraph br The sound that corresponds to the letter s is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a voiceless apico alveolar sibilant s also described acoustically as grave and articulatorily as retracted with a weak hushing sound reminiscent of retroflex fricatives In Andalusia Canary Islands and most of Hispanic America except in the Paisa region of Colombia it is pronounced as a voiceless dental sibilant s much like the most frequent pronunciation of the s of English br The phoneme spelled ll a palatal lateral consonant that can be approximated by the sound of the lli of English million tends to be maintained in less urbanized areas of northern Spain and in the highland areas of South America as well as in Paraguay and lowland Bolivia Meanwhile in the speech of most other Spanish speakers it is merged with curly tail j a non lateral usually voiced usually fricative palatal consonant sometimes compared to English j yod as in yacht and spelled y in Spanish As with other forms of allophony across world languages the small difference of the spelled ll and the spelled y is usually not perceived the difference is not heard by people who do not produce them as different phonemes Such a phonemic merger is called ye smo in Spanish In Rioplatense Spanish the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative either voiced as in English measure or the French j in the central and western parts of the dialectal region zhe smo or voiceless as in the French ch or Portuguese x in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo she smo br br br Morphology br The main morphological variations between dialects of Spanish involve differing uses of pronouns especially those of the second person and to a lesser extent the object pronouns of the third person br br br Voseo br br Virtually all dialects of Spanish make the distinction between a formal and a familiar register in the second person singular and thus have two different pronouns meaning you usted in the formal and either t or vos in the familiar and each of these three pronouns has its associated verb forms with the choice of t or vos varying from one dialect to another The use of vos and its verb forms is called voseo In a few dialects all three pronouns are used with usted t and vos denoting respectively formality familiarity and intimacy br In voseo vos is the subject form vos dec s you say and the form for the object of a preposition voy con vos I am going with you while the direct and indirect object forms and the possessives are the same as those associated with t Vos sab s que tus amigos te respetan You know your friends respect you br The verb forms of the general voseo are the same as those used with t except in the present tense indicative and imperative verbs The forms for vos generally can be derived from those of vosotros the traditional second person familiar plural by deleting the glide i or d where it appears in the ending vosotros pens is vos pens s vosotros volv is vos volv s pensad vosotros pens vos volved vosotros volv vos br br In Central American voseo the t and vos forms differ in the present subjunctive as well br br In Chilean voseo almost all vos forms are distinct from the corresponding standard t forms br br The use of the pronoun vos with the verb forms of t vos piensas is called pronominal voseo Conversely the use of the verb forms of vos with the pronoun t t pens s or t pens i is called verbal voseo In Chile for example verbal voseo is much more common than the actual use of the pronoun vos which is usually reserved for highly informal situations br br br Distribution in Spanish speaking regions of the Americas br Although vos is not used in Spain it occurs in many Spanish speaking regions of the Americas as the primary spoken form of the second person singular familiar pronoun with wide differences in social consideration Generally it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of tuteo the use of t in the following areas almost all of Mexico the West Indies Panama most of Colombia Peru Venezuela and coastal Ecuador br Tuteo as a cultured form alternates with voseo as a popular or rural form in Bolivia in the north and south of Peru in Andean Ecuador in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes and most notably in the Venezuelan state of Zulia and in a large part of Colombia Some researchers maintain that voseo can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba and others assert that it is absent from the island br Tuteo exists as the second person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar voseo in Chile in the Venezuelan state of Zulia on the Caribbean coast of Colombia in the Azuero Peninsula in Panama in the Mexican state of Chiapas and in parts of Guatemala br Areas of generalized voseo include Argentina Nicaragua eastern Bolivia El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Costa Rica Paraguay Uruguay and the Colombian departments of Antioquia Caldas Risaralda Quindio and Valle del Cauca br br br Ustedes br Ustedes functions as formal and informal second person plural in all of Hispanic America the Canary Islands and parts of Andalusia It agrees with verbs in the rd person plural Most of Spain maintains the formal familiar distinction with ustedes and vosotros respectively The use of ustedes with the second person plural is sometimes heard in Andalusia but it is non standard br br br Usted br Usted is the usual second person singular pronoun in a formal context but it is used jointly with the third person singular voice of the verb It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority you sir you ma am It is also used in a familiar context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama to the exclusion of t or vos This usage is sometimes called ustedeo in Spanish br In Central America especially in Honduras usted is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple Usted is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador Colombia and Venezuela br br br Third person object pronouns br Most speakers use and the Real Academia Espa ola prefers the pronouns lo and la for direct objects masculine and feminine respectively regardless of animacy meaning him her or it and le for indirect objects regardless of gender or animacy meaning to him to her or to it The usage is sometimes called etymological as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation respectively of the accusative and dative pronouns of Latin the ancestor language of Spanish br Deviations from this norm more common in Spain than in the Americas are called le smo lo smo or la smo according to which respective pronoun le lo or la has expanded beyond the etymological usage le as a direct object or lo or la as an indirect object br br br Vocabulary br Some words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages For example Spanish mantequilla aguacate and albaricoque respectively butter avocado apricot correspond to manteca word used for lard in Peninsular Spanish palta and damasco respectively in Argentina Chile except manteca Paraguay Peru except manteca and damasco and Uruguay In the healthcare context an assessment of the Spanish translation of the QWB SA identified some regional vocabulary choices and US specific concepts which cannot be successfully implemented in Spain without adaptation br br br Vocabulary br Around of everyday Spanish vocabulary is of Latin origin Most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in Spanish comes from Latin The Spanish words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly words of Latin origin These words of Latin origin can be classified as heritage words cultisms and semi cultisms br Most of the Spanish lexicon is made up of heritage lexicon Heritage or directly inherited words are those whose presence in the spoken language has been continued since before the differentiation of the Romance languages Heritage words are characterized by having undergone all the phonetic changes experienced by the language This differentiates it from the cultisms and semi cultisms that were no longer used in the spoken language and were later reintroduced for restricted uses Because of this cultisms generally have not experienced some of the phonetic changes and present a different form than they would have if they had been transmitted with heritage words br In the philological tradition of Spanish cultism is called a word whose morphology very strictly follows its Greek or Latin etymological origin without undergoing the changes that the evolution of the Spanish language followed from its origin in Vulgar Latin The same concept also exists in other Romance languages Reintroduced into the language for cultural literary or scientific considerations cultism only adapts its form to the orthographic and phonological conventions derived from linguistic evolution but ignores the transformations that the roots and morphemes underwent in the development of the Romance language br In some cases cultisms are used to introduce technical or specialized terminology that present in the classical language did not appear in the Romance language due to lack of use This is the case of many of the literary legal and philosophical terms of classical culture such as ataraxia from the Greek dispassion or legislar built from the Latin legislator In other cases they construct neologisms such as the name of most scientific disciplines br A semi cultism is a word that did not evolve in the expected way in the vernacular language Romance language unlike heritage words its evolution is incomplete Many times interrupted by cultural influences ecclesiastical legal administrative etc For the same reason they maintain some features of the language of origin Dios is a clear example of semi cultism where it came from the Latin Deus It is a semi cultism because it maintains without fully adapting to Castilianization in this case some characteristics of the Latin language the ending in s but at the same time it undergoes slight phonetic modifications change of eu for io Deus Dios instead of remaining cultist Deus Deus or becoming a heritage word Deus D o The Catholic Church influenced by stopping the natural evolution of this word and in this way converted this word into a semi cultism and unconsciously prevented it from becoming a heritage word br Spanish vocabulary has been influenced by several languages As in other European languages Classical Greek words Hellenisms are abundant in the terminologies of several fields including art science politics nature etc Its vocabulary has also been influenced by Arabic having developed during the Al Andalus era in the Iberian Peninsula with around of its vocabulary having Arabic lexical roots It has also been influenced by Basque Iberian Celtiberian Visigothic and other neighboring Ibero Romance languages Additionally it has absorbed vocabulary from other languages particularly other Romance languages such as French Mozarabic Portuguese Galician Catalan Occitan and Sardinian as well as from Quechua Nahuatl and other indigenous languages of the Americas In the th century words taken from French referring above all to fashion cooking and bureaucracy were added to the Spanish lexicon In the th century new loanwords were incorporated especially from English and German but also from Italian in areas related to music particularly opera and cooking In the th century the pressure of English in the fields of technology computing science and sports was greatly accentuated br In general Latin America is more susceptible to loanwords from English or Anglicisms For example mouse computer mouse is used in Latin America in Spain rat n is used This happens largely due to closer contact with the United States For its part Spain is known by the use of Gallicisms or words taken from neighboring France such as the Gallicism ordenador in the European Spanish in contrast to the Anglicism computador or computadora in American Spanish br br br Relation to other languages br br Spanish is closely related to the other West Iberian Romance languages including Asturian Aragonese Galician Ladino Leonese Mirandese and Portuguese It is somewhat less similar to varying degrees from other members of the Romance language family br It is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility Mutual intelligibility of the written Spanish and Portuguese languages is high lexically and grammatically Ethnologue gives estimates of the lexical similarity between related languages in terms of precise percentages For Spanish and Portuguese that figure is although phonologically the two languages are quite dissimilar Italian on the other hand is phonologically similar to Spanish while sharing lower lexical and grammatical similarity of Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and French or between Spanish and Romanian is lower still given lexical similarity ratings of and respectively Comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower at an estimated In general thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication br The following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages br br In Romance etymology Latin terms are given in the Accusative since most forms derive from this case br As in us very selves an

etymology br br br Judaeo Spanish br br Judaeo Spanish also known as Ladino is a variety of Spanish which preserves many features of medieval Spanish and some old Portuguese and is spoken by descendants of the Sephardi Jews who were expelled from Spain in the th century While in Portugal the conversion of Jews occurred earlier and the assimilation of New Christians was overwhelming in Spain the Jews kept their language and identity The relationship of Ladino and Spanish is therefore comparable with that of the Yiddish language to German Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively Sephardi Jews with family roots in Turkey Greece or the Balkans and living mostly in Israel Turkey and the United States with a few communities in Hispanic America Judaeo Spanish lacks the Native American vocabulary which was acquired by standard Spanish during the Spanish colonial period and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish It contains however other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish including vocabulary from Hebrew French Greek and Turkish and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled br Judaeo Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly olim immigrants to Israel who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren However it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities especially in music In Latin American communities the danger of extinction is also due to assimilation by modern Spanish br A related dialect is Haketia the Judaeo Spanish of northern Morocco This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish during the Spanish occupation of the region br br br Writing system br br Spanish is written in the Latin script with the addition of the character e e representing the phoneme a letter distinct from n although typographically composed of an n with a tilde Formerly the digraphs ch che representing the phoneme t and ll elle representing the phoneme or were also considered single letters However the digraph rr erre fuerte strong r erre doble double r or simply erre which also represents a distinct phoneme r was not similarly regarded as a single letter Since ch and ll have been treated as letter pairs for collation purposes though they remained a part of the alphabet until Words with ch are now alphabetically sorted between those with cg and ci instead of following cz as they used to The situation is similar for ll br Thus the Spanish alphabet has the following letters br br A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z br Since none of the digraphs ch ll rr gu qu are considered letters by the Royal Spanish Academy br The letters k and w are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages kilo folklore whisky kiwi etc br With the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as M xico see Toponymy of Mexico pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling Under the orthographic conventions a typical Spanish word is stressed on the syllable before the last if it ends with a vowel not including y or with a vowel followed by n or an s it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an acute accent on the stressed vowel br The acute accent is used in addition to distinguish between certain homophones especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a clitic compare el the masculine singular definite article with l he or it or te you object pronoun with t tea de preposition of versus d give formal imperative third person present subjunctive and se reflexive pronoun versus s I know or imperative be br The interrogative pronouns qu cu l d nde qui n etc also receive accents in direct or indirect questions and some demonstratives se ste aqu l etc can be accented when used as pronouns Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters a widespread practice in the days of typewriters and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents although the Real Academia Espa ola advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent br When u is written between g and a front vowel e or i it indicates a hard g pronunciation A diaeresis indicates that it is not silent as
