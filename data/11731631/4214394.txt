A practical joke or prank is a trick played on people or people generally causing the victim to experience embarrassment perplexity confusion or discomfort The perpetrator of a practical joke is called a practical joker or prankster Other terms for practical jokes include gag rib jape or shenanigan Some countries in western nations make it tradition to carry out pranks on April Fools Day and Mischief Night br br Practical jokes differ from confidence tricks or hoaxes in that the victim finds out or is let in on the joke rather than being talked into handing over money or other valuables Practical jokes are generally lighthearted and without lasting effect they aim to make the victim feel humbled or foolish but not victimized or humiliated Thus most practical jokes are affectionate gestures of humour and designed to encourage laughter However practical jokes performed with cruelty can constitute bullying whose intent is to harass or exclude rather than reinforce social bonds through ritual humbling br br A practical joke is practical because it consists of someone doing something that is physical in contrast to a verbal or written joke For example the joker who is setting up and conducting the practical joke might hang a bucket of water above a doorway and rig the bucket using pulleys so when the door opens the bucket dumps the water The joker would then wait for the victim to walk through the doorway and be drenched by the bucket of water Objects can feature in practical jokes like fake vomit chewing gum bugs exploding cigars stink bombs costumes whoopee cushions
