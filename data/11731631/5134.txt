Chess is a board game for two players It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi Chinese chess and shogi Japanese chess br Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance It is played on a chessboard with squares arranged in an grid The players referred to as White and Black each control sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns White moves first followed by Black The game is won by checkmating the opponent s king i e threatening it with inescapable capture There are several ways a game can end in a draw br The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game chaturanga in seventh century India After its introduction in Persia it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe The rules of chess as they are known today emerged in Europe at the end of the th century with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the th century Today chess is one of the world s most popular games and is played by millions of people worldwide br Organized chess arose in the th century Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE F d ration Internationale des checs the International Chess Federation The first universally recognized World Chess Champion Wilhelm Steinitz claimed his title in Ding Liren is the current World Champion br A huge body of chess theory has developed since the game s inception Aspects of art are found in chess composition and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and the arts and has connections with other fields such as mathematics computer science and psychology One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess playing machine In Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov Today s chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory however chess is not a solved game br br br Rules br br The rules of chess are published by FIDE F d ration Internationale des checs International Chess Federation chess s world governing body in its Handbook Rules published by national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc may differ in some details FIDE s rules were most recently revised in br br br Setup br br Chess sets come in a wide variety of styles The Staunton pattern is the most common and is usually required for competition Chess pieces are divided into two sets usually light and dark colored referred to as white and black regardless of the actual color or design The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black respectively Each set consists of sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns br The game is played on a square board of eight rows called ranks and eight columns called files By convention the squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares common colors for chessboards are white and brown or white and green br br The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo Thus on White s first rank from left to right the pieces are placed as follows rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight rook Eight pawns are placed on the second rank Black s position mirrors White s with an equivalent piece on the same file The board is placed with a light square at the right hand corner nearest to each player The correct position of the light square may be remembered by the phrase light on right while the correct positions of the king and queen may be remembered by the phrase queen on her own color i e the white queen begins on a light square and the black queen on a dark square br In competitive games the piece colors are allocated to players by the organizers in informal games the colors are usually decided randomly for example by a coin toss or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose br br br Movement br White moves first after which players alternate turns moving one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent s piece which is captured and removed from play With the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent s piece occupies Moving is compulsory a player may not skip a turn even when having to move is detrimental br Each piece has its own way of moving In the diagrams crosses mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece s of either color except the knight which leaps over any intervening pieces All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is on a square to which they could move if the square were unoccupied Pieces are generally not permitted to move through squares occupied by pieces of either color except for the knight and during castling br br The king moves one square in any direction There is also a special move called castling that involves moving the king and a rook The king is the most valuable piece attacks on the king must be immediately countered and if this is impossible the game is immediately lost see Check and checkmate below br A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file but cannot leap over other pieces Along with the king a rook is involved during the king s castling move br A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but cannot leap over other pieces br A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank file or diagonal but cannot leap over other pieces br A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal Thus the move forms an L shape two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces br A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram A pawn can capture an opponent s piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square black crosses It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file nor can it move to either square diagonally in front without capturing A pawn has two special moves the en passant capture and promotion br br br Check and checkmate br br When a king is under immediate attack it is said to be in check A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check There are three ways to counter a check br br Capture the checking piece br Interpose a piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen rook or bishop and there is a square between it and the king br Move the king to a square where it is not under attack br Castling is not a permissible response to a check br The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponent s king is in check and there is no legal way to get it out of check It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player s own king in check In casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponent s king in check but this is not required by the rules of chess and is usually not done in tournaments br br br Castling br br Once per game each king can make a move known as castling Castling consists of moving the king two squares toward a rook of the same color on the same rank and then placing the rook on the square that the king crossed br Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met br br Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game br There are no pieces between the king and the rook br The king is not in check and does not pass through or finish on a square attacked by an enemy piece br Castling is still permitted if the rook is under attack or if the rook crosses an attacked square br br br En passant br br When a pawn makes a two step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent s pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file then the opponent s pawn can capture it en passant in passing moving to the square the pawn passed over This can be done only on the turn immediately following the enemy pawn s two square advance otherwise the right to do so is forfeited For example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two squares from g to g and the white pawn on f can take it en passant on g but only immediately after the black pawn s advance br br br Promotion br br When a pawn advances to its eighth rank as part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player s choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color Usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion In the animated diagram the pawn on c can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted There is no restriction on the piece promoted to so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game e g two or more queens If the required piece is not available e g a second queen an inverted rook is sometimes used as a substitute but this is not recognized in FIDE sanctioned games br br br End of the game br br br Win br A game can be won in the following ways br br Checkmate The opposing king is in check and the opponent has no legal move See check and checkmate above br Resignation A player may resign conceding the game to the opponent If however the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player this is a draw under FIDE Laws Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in a hopeless position br Win on time In games with a time control a player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has a superior position as long as the player has a theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue br Forfeit A player who cheats violates the rules or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited Occasionally both players are forfeited br br br Draw br There are several ways a game can end in a draw br br Stalemate If the player to move has no legal move but is not in check the position is a stalemate and the game is drawn br Dead position If neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves the game is drawn For example if only the kings are on the board all other pieces having been captured checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule On the other hand if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply The dead position rule supersedes the previous rule which referred to insufficient material extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns cannot be attacked br Draw by agreement In tournament chess draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make a move then start the opponent s clock Traditionally players have been allowed to agree to a draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing a move More recently efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty br Threefold repetition This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage In this situation either player can claim a draw this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid The addition of the fivefold repetition rule in requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game a draw after five occurrences of the same position consecutive or otherwise without requiring a claim by either player FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition br Fifty move rule If during the previous moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim a draw The addition of the seventy five move rule in requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after moves without a pawn move or capture without requiring a claim by either player There are several known endgames where it is possible to force a mate but it requires more than moves before a pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops Historically FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty move rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty move rule br Draw on time In games with a time control the game is drawn if a player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player br Draw by resignation Under FIDE Laws a game is drawn if a player resigns and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate that player br br br Time control br br In competition chess games are played with a time control If a player s time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate The duration of a game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under minutes per player for the entire game Intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between one and two hours per game a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments br Time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays one for each player s remaining time Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments br Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions A typical time control is days for every moves br br br Notation br br Historically many different notation systems have been used to record chess moves the standard system today is short form algebraic notation In this system each square is uniquely identified by a set of coordinates a h for the files followed by for the ranks The usual format is br br initial of the piece moved file of destination square rank of destination square br The pieces are identified by their initials In English these are K king Q queen R rook B bishop and N knight N is used to avoid confusion with king For example Qg means queen moves to the g file th rank that is to the square g Different initials may be used for other languages In chess literature figurine algebraic notation FAN is frequently used to aid understanding independent of language br br To resolve ambiguities an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved e g Ngf means knight from the g file moves to the square f R e means rook on the first rank moves to e For pawns no letter initial is used so e means pawn moves to the square e br If the piece makes a capture x is usually inserted before the destination square Thus Bxf means bishop captures on f When a pawn makes a capture the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn making the capture for example exd pawn on the e file captures the piece on d Ranks may be omitted if unambiguous for example exd pawn on the e file captures a piece somewhere on the d file A minority of publications use to indicate a capture and some omit the capture symbol altogether In its most abbreviated form exd may be rendered simply as ed An en passant capture may optionally be marked with the notation e p br If a pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example e Q or e Q Castling is indicated by the special notations or O O for kingside castling and or O O O for queenside castling A move that places the opponent s king in check usually has the notation added There are no specific notations for discovered check or double check Checkmate can be indicated by At the end of the game means White won means Black won and indicates a draw br Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols For example indicates a good move an excellent move a mistake a blunder an interesting move that may not be best or a dubious move not easily refuted br br For example one variation of a simple trap known as the Scholar s mate see animated diagram can be recorded br br e e Qh Nc Bc Nf Qxf br Variants of algebraic notation include long algebraic in which both the departure and destination square are indicated abbreviated algebraic in which capture signs check signs and ranks of pawn captures may be omitted and Figurine Algebraic Notation used in chess publications for universal readability regardless of language br Portable Game Notation PGN is a text based file format for recording chess games based on short form English algebraic notation with a small amount of markup PGN files suffix pgn can be processed by most chess software as well as being easily readable by humans br Until about the majority of English language chess publications used descriptive notation in which files are identified by the initial letter of the piece that occupies the first rank at the beginning of the game In descriptive notation the common opening move e is rendered as P K pawn to king four Another system is ICCF numeric notation recognized by the International Correspondence Chess Federation though its use is in decline br In tournament games players are normally required to keep a score record of the game For this purpose only algebraic notation is recognized in FIDE sanctioned events game scores recorded in a different notation system may not be used as evidence in the event of a dispute br br br Chess in public spaces br Chess is often played casually in public spaces such as parks and town squares br br br Organized competition br br br Tournaments and matches br br Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues tournaments and congresses Thousands of chess tournaments matches and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels br Tournaments with a small number of players may use the round robin format in which every player plays one game against every other player For a large number of players the Swiss system may be used in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same or as similar as possible score in each round In either case a player s score is usually calculated as point for each game won and one half point for each game drawn Variations such as football scoring points for a win point for a draw may be used by tournament organizers but ratings are always calculated on the basis of standard scoring A player s score may be reported as total score out of games played e g points for versus points against e g or by number of wins losses and draws e g br The term match refers not to an individual game but to either a series of games between two players or a team competition in which each player of one team plays one game against a player of the other team br br br Governance br Chess s international governing body is usually known by its French acronym FIDE pronounced FEE day French F d ration internationale des checs or International Chess Federation FIDE s membership consists of the national chess organizations of over countries there are also several associate members including various supra national organizations the International Braille Chess Association IBCA International Committee of Chess for the Deaf ICCD and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association IPCA FIDE is recognized as a sports governing body by the International Olympic Committee but chess has never been part of the Olympic Games br br FIDE s most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship a role it assumed in The current World Champion is Ding Liren of China The reigning Women s World Champion is Ju Wenjun from China br Other competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship the European Individual Chess Championship the tournaments for the World Championship qualification cycle and the various national championships Invitation only tournaments regularly attract the world s strongest players Examples include Spain s Linares event Monte Carlo s Melody Amber tournament the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting Sofia s M tel Masters and Wijk aan Zee s Tata Steel tournament br Regular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship br The World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess Championships include both team and individual events these are held independently of FIDE br br br Titles and rankings br br In order to rank players FIDE ICCF and most national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo An average club player has a rating of about the highest FIDE rating of all time was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March FIDE rating list br Players may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE br br Grandmaster GM sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used is awarded to world class chess masters Apart from World Champion Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain Before FIDE will confer the title on a player the player must have an Elo rating of at least at one time and three results of a prescribed standard called norms in tournaments involving other grandmasters including some from countries other than the applicant s There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title such as winning the World Junior Championship br International Master IM The conditions are similar to GM but less demanding The minimum rating for the IM title is br FIDE Master FM The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of or more br Candidate Master CM Similar to FM but with a FIDE rating of at least br The above titles are open to both men and women There are also separate women only titles Woman Grandmaster WGM Woman International Master WIM Woman FIDE Master WFM and Woman Candidate Master WCM These require a performance level approximately Elo rating points below the similarly named open titles and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in a number of women have earned the open GM title as of July br FIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players by the International Correspondence Chess Federation National chess organizations may also award titles br br br Theory br br Chess has an extensive literature In the chess historian H J R Murray estimated the total number of books magazines and chess columns in newspapers to be about B H Wood estimated the number as of to be about David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications No one knows how many have been printed Significant public chess libraries include the John G White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library with over chess books and over bound volumes of chess periodicals and the Chess Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands with about books br Chess theory usually divides the game of chess into three phases with different sets of strategies the opening typically the first to moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle the middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take a more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive br Opening theory is concerned with finding the best moves in the initial phase of the game There are dozens of different openings and hundreds of variants The Oxford Companion to Chess lists named openings and variants br Middlegame theory is usually divided into chess tactics and chess strategy Chess strategy concentrates on setting and achieving long term positional advantages during the game for example where to place different pieces while tactics concerns immediate maneuver These two aspects of the gameplay cannot be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play br Endgame theory is concerned with positions where there are only a few pieces left These positions are categorized according to the pieces for example King and pawn endings or Rook versus minor piece endings br br br Opening br br A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game the opening moves Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings There are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the R ti Opening to very aggressive the Latvian Gambit In some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than moves Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve br The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar br br Development This is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game br Control of the center Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent br King safety It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities A correctly timed castling can often enhance this br Pawn structure Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands and to force such weaknesses in the opponent s position br Most players and theoreticians consider that White by virtue of the first move begins the game with a small advantage This initially gives White the initiative Black usually strives to neutralize White s advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position br br br Middlegame br br The middlegame is the part of the game that starts after the opening There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed Similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame Because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent s king Some typical patterns have their own names for example the Boden s Mate or the Lasker Bauer combination br Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings that result in a specific type of pawn structure An example is the minority attack which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames br Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame i e simplify Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose for example if one side keeps a light squared bishop and the opponent has a dark squared one the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw even with an advantage of a pawn or sometimes even with a two pawn advantage br br br Tactics br br In chess tactics in general concentrate on short term actions so short term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or a computer The possible depth of calculation depends on the player s ability In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in positions with a limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves br Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences Simple one move or two move tactical actions threats exchanges of material and double attacks can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination Brilliant combinations such as those in the Immortal Game are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers A common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players skills is a position where a decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it br br br Strategy br br Chess strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long term plans for future play During the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares br The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides The point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game But in practical terms in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece e g advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces e g a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight or the type of position e g knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions br Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton the configuration of pawns on the chessboard Since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position Weaknesses in pawn structure include isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created they are often permanent Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack br br br Endgame br br The endgame also end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame br br Pawns become more important Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote a pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank br The king which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame emerges as a strong piece in the endgame It is often brought to the center where it can protect its own pawns attack enemy pawns and hinder moves of the opponent s king br Zugzwang a situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur a disadvantage is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game In the example diagram either side having the move is in zugzwang Black to move must play Kb allowing White to promote the pawn after Kd White to move must permit a draw either by Kc stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move br Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king with the pieces working together with their king For example king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings such as rook and pawn versus rook endgames br br br History br br br Origins br br Texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the seventh century Three are written in Pahlavi Middle Persian and one the Harshacharita is in Sanskrit One of these texts the Chatrang namak represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang Chess in Pahlavi was introduced to Persia by Dewasarm a great ruler of India during the reign of Khosrow I br br Dewasarm has fashioned this chatrang after the likeness of a battle and in its likeness are two supreme rulers after the likeness of Kings shah with the essentials of rooks rukh to right and to left with Counsellor farzin in the likeness of a commander of the champions with the Elephant pil in the likeness of the commander of the rearguard with Horse asp in the likeness of the commander of the cavalry with the Footsoldier piyadak in the likeness of so many infantry in the vanguard of the battle br The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about written by al Adli ar Rumi a renowned Arab chess player titled Kitab ash shatranj The Book of Chess This is a lost manuscript but is referenced in later works Here also al Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India along with the eighth century collection of fables Kal la wa Dimna By the th century a substantial consensus developed regarding chess s origins in northwest India in the early seventh century More recently this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny br The early forms of chess in India were known as chatura ga Sanskrit literally four divisions of the military infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by pieces that would later evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively Chaturanga was played on an uncheckered board called asht pada Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road The earliest evidence of chess is found in nearby Sasanian Persia around A D where the game came to be known by the name chatrang Persian Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia where it was then named shatranj Arabic Persian with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names In Spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez al shatranj in Portuguese as xadrez and in Greek as zatrikion which comes directly from the Persian chatrang but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian sh h king from which the English words check and chess descend The word checkmate is derived from the Persian sh h m t the king is dead br br Xiangqi is the form of chess best known in China The eastern migration of chess into China and Southeast Asia has even less documentation than its migration west making it largely conjectured The word xi ngq was used in China to refer to a game from A D at the latest but it has not been proven if this game was or was not directly related to chess br The first reference to Chinese chess appears in a book entitled Xu ngua L Record of the Mysterious and Strange dating to about A minority view holds that Western chess arose from xi ngq or one of its predecessors Chess historians Jean Louis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton contend that xiangqi s intrinsic characteristics make it easier to construct an evolutionary path from China to India Persia than the opposite direction br The oldest archaeological chess artifacts ivory pieces were excavated in ancient Afrasiab today s Samarkand in Uzbekistan Central Asia and date to about with some of them possibly being older Remarkably almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the Silk Road from the former regions of the Tarim Basin today s Xinjiang in China Transoxiana Sogdiana Bactria Gandhara to Iran on one end and to India through Kashmir on the other br The game reached Western Europe and Russia via at least three routes the earliest being in the ninth century By the year it had spread throughout both the Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe A Latin poem called Versus de scachis Verses on Chess dated to the late th century has been preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland br br br Origins of the modern game br The game of chess was then played and known in all European countries A famous th century Spanish manuscript covering chess backgammon and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games The rules were fundamentally similar to those of the Arabic shatranj The differences were mostly in the use of a checkered board instead of a plain monochrome board used by Arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step In some regions the queen which had replaced the wazir or the king could also make an initial two square leap under some conditions br br Around the rules of shatranj started to be modified in Europe culminating several major changes later in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today A major change was the modern piece movement rules which began to appear in intellectual circles in Valencia Spain around which established the foundations and brought it very close to current chess These new rules then were quickly adopted in Italy and Southern France before diffusing into the rest of Europe Pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the th century and by the th century had become the most powerful piece in light of that modern chess was often referred to at the time as Queen s Chess or Mad Queen Chess Castling derived from the king s leap usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety was introduced These new rules quickly spread throughout Western Europe br Writings about chess theory began to appear in the late th century An anonymous treatise on chess of with the first part containing some openings and the second endgames is deposited in the library of the University of G ttingen The book El Libro dels jochs partitis dels schachs en nombre de was written by Francesc Vicent in Segorbe in but no copy of this work has survived The Repetici n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess by Spanish churchman Luis Ram rez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco and Spanish bishop Ruy L pez de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames br br br Romantic era br br In the th century the center of European chess life moved from Southern Europe to mainland France The two most important French masters were Fran ois Andr Danican Philidor a musician by profession who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy and later Louis Charles Mah de La Bourdonnais who won a famous series of matches against Irish master Alexander McDonnell in Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Caf de la R gence in Paris and Simpson s Divan in London br At the same time the intellectual movement of romanticism had had a far reaching impact on chess with aesthetics and tactical beauty being held in higher regard than objective soundness and strategic planning As a result virtually all games began with the Open Game and it was considered unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the King s Gambit and the Evans Gambit This chess philosophy is known as Romantic chess and a sharp tactical style consistent with the principles of chess romanticism was predominant until the late th century br The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early th century Also in the th century the convention that White moves first was established formerly either White or Black could move first Finally the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized variations in these rules persisted in Italy until the late th century The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent Since the th century the only rule changes such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition have been technical in nature br br As the th century progressed chess organization developed quickly Many chess clubs chess books and chess journals appeared There were correspondence matches between cities for example the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in Chess problems became a regular part of th century newspapers Bernhard Horwitz Josef Kling and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems In von der Lasa published his and Bilguer s Handbuch des Schachspiels Handbook of Chess the first comprehensive manual of chess theory br The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton a leading English chess player and was held in London in It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master His brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time Sparkling games like Anderssen s Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy s Opera Game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the art of chess br Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy Morphy won against all important competitors except Staunton who refused to play including Anderssen during his short chess career between and Morphy s success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks br br br Birth of a sport br br Prague born Wilhelm Steinitz laid the foundations for a scientific approach to the game the art of breaking a position down into components and preparing correct plans In addition to his theoretical achievements Steinitz founded an important tradition his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship This win marked a stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking tactical style predominant in the Romantic era to a more positional strategic style introduced to the chess world by Steinitz Steinitz lost his crown in to a much younger player the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker who maintained this title for years the longest tenure of any world champion br After the end of the th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew The first Olympiad was held in Paris in and FIDE was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event In the Women s World Chess Championship was established the first to hold the title was Czech English master Vera Menchik br A prodigy from Cuba Jos Ra l Capablanca known for his skill in endgames won the World Championship from Lasker in Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years from to His successor was the Russian French Alexander Alekhine a strong attacking player who died as the world champion in Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in and regained it two years later br In the interwar period chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard R ti They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack br br br Post World War II era br br After the death of Alekhine a new World Champion was sought FIDE which has controlled the title since then ran a tournament of elite players The winner of the tournament was Russian Mikhail Botvinnik In FIDE established a system of titles conferring the title of Grandmaster on players Some sources state that in the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker Capablanca Alekhine Tarrasch and Marshall but this is a disputed claim br Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world which mainly through the Soviet government s politically inspired efforts to demonstrate intellectual superiority over the West stood almost uninterrupted for more than a half century Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union there was only one non Soviet champion American Bobby Fischer champion Botvinnik also revolutionized opening theory Previously Black strove for equality attempting to neutralize White s first move advantage As Black Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning In the previous informal system of World Championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches The world s strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go through the Candidates stage which was initially a tournament and later a series of knockout matches The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later This system operated on a three year cycle Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years He won the world championship tournament in and retained the title in tied matches in and In he lost to Vasily Smyslov but regained the title in a rematch in In he lost the title to the year old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever hence his nickname the magician from Riga Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in br Following the event FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch and the next champion Armenian Tigran Petrosian a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills held the title for two cycles His successor Boris Spassky from Russia champion won games in both positional and sharp tactical style The next championship the so called Match of the Century saw the first non Soviet challenger since World War II American Bobby Fischer Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard of margins and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship The match was followed closely by news media of the day leading to a surge in popularity for chess it also held significant political importance at the height of the Cold War with the match being seen by both sides as a microcosm of the conflict between East and West In however Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when he was unable to reach agreement on conditions with FIDE and Karpov obtained the title by default Fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings br Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the s and early s with a string of tournament successes In the World Chess Championship Karpov faced his toughest challenge to date the young Garry Kasparov from Baku Soviet Azerbaijan The match was aborted in controversial circumstances after months and games with Karpov leading by wins to but evidently exhausted many commentators believed Kasparov who had won the last two games would have won the match had it continued Kasparov won the rematch Kasparov and Karpov contested three further closely fought matches in and Kasparov winning them all Kasparov became the dominant figure of world chess from the mid s until his retirement from competition in br br br Beginnings of chess technology br Chess playing computer programs later known as chess engines began to appear in the s In the first major computer chess tournament the North American Computer Chess Championship was held followed in by the first World Computer Chess Championship In the late s dedicated home chess computers such as Fidelity Electronics Chess Challenger became commercially available as well as software to run on home computers The overall standard of computer chess was low however until the s br The first endgame tablebases which provided perfect play for relatively simple endgames such as king and rook versus king and bishop appeared in the late s This set a precedent to the complete six and seven piece tablebases that became available in the s and s respectively br The first commercial chess database a collection of chess games searchable by move and position was introduced by the German company ChessBase in Databases containing millions of chess games have since had a profound effect on opening theory and other areas of chess research br Digital chess clocks were invented in though they did not become commonplace until the s Digital clocks allow for time controls involving increments and delays br br br present Rise of computers and online chess br br br Technology br The Internet enabled online chess as a new medium of playing with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time The first such server known as Internet Chess Server or ICS was developed at the University of Utah in ICS formed the basis for the first commercial chess server the Internet Chess Club which was launched in and for other early chess servers such as FICS Free Internet Chess Server Since then many other platforms have appeared and online chess began to rival over the board chess in popularity During the COVID pandemic the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world combined with the success of the popular Netflix show The Queen s Gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments notably PogChamps and chess Twitch streamers resulted in a surge of popularity not only for online chess but for the game of chess in general this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the online chess boom br Computer chess has also seen major advances By the s chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs and in Deep Blue defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in a six game match starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess In the s engines significantly stronger than even the best human players became accessible for free on a number of PC and mobile platforms and free engine analysis became a commonplace feature on internet chess servers An adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating which has grown to be a major concern in both over the board and online chess In AlphaZero a neural network also capable of playing shogi and Go was introduced Since then many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written the best of which have surpassed the traditional brute force engines AlphaZero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game which affected the style of play at the top level br As endgame tablebases developed they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game theoretical outcome was previously unknown such as positions with king queen and pawn against king and queen In Lewis Stiller published a tablebase for select six piece endgames and by following the publication of Nalimov tablebases all six piece endgame positions were solved In Lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven piece endgame positions Use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis br Technological progress made in the s and the st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels as well as the state of chess as a spectator sport br Previously preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as Chess Informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents games Today preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties A number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels such as online courses tactics trainers and video lessons br Since the late s it has been possible to follow major international chess events online the players moves being relayed in real time Sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves Chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities While in the past the moves have been relayed live today chess organizers will often impose a half hour delay as an anti cheating measure In the mid to late s and especially following the online boom it became commonplace for supergrandmasters such as Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen to livestream chess content on platforms such as Twitch Also following the boom online chess started being viewed as an esport with esport teams signing chess players for the first time in br br br Growth br Organized chess even for young children has become common FIDE holds world championships for age levels down to years old The largest tournaments in number of players are those held for children br The number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era Kenneth Regan and Guy Haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines They concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher Elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play rather than rating inflation or title inflation br br br Professional chess br In Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke ties with FIDE to organize their own match for the World Championship and formed a competing Professional Chess Association PCA From then until there were two simultaneous World Championships and respective World Champions the PCA or classical champions extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of games and the other following FIDE s new format of many players competing in a large knockout tournament to determine the champion Kasparov lost his PCA title in to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia Due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships Kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again Despite this he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world s highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in br The World Chess Championship in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion In September he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India who won the championship tournament in Mexico City Anand defended his title in the revenge match of and Magnus Carlsen defeated Anand in the World Chess Championship and defended his title in and After the match he announced that he would not defend his title a fifth time so the World Chess Championship was played between the winner and runner up of the Candidates Tournament respectively Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia and Ding Liren of China Ding beat Nepomniachtchi making him the current World Chess

there happeneth a very rare thing namely that the meane is more commendable then the excellency br Some of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy at least partially survive such as the Lewis chessmen br Chess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality An example is Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess written by an Italian Dominican friar Jacobus de Cessolis c This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages The work was translated into many other languages the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in and was the basis for William Caxton s The Game and Playe of the Chesse one of the first books printed in English Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces br br The knyght ought to be made alle armed upon an

pieces Roch pedites regina The game of chess at times has been discouraged by various religious authorities in Middle Ages Jewish Catholic and Orthodox Some Muslim authorities prohibited it even recently for example Ruhollah Khomeini in and Abdul Aziz ash Sheikh even later br During the Age of Enlightenment chess was viewed as a means of self improvement Benjamin Franklin in his article The Morals of Chess wrote br br The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired and strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions for life is a kind of Chess in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effect of prudence or the want of it By playing at Chess then we may learn br I Foresight which looks a little into futurity and considers the consequences that may attend an action br II Circumspection which surveys the whole Chess board or scene of action the relation of the several Pieces and their situations br III Caution not to make our moves too hastily br br Chess was occasionally criticized in the th century as a waste of time br Chess is taught to children in schools around the world today Many schools host chess clubs and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children Tournaments are held regularly in many countries hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation br Chess is many times depicted in the arts significant works where chess plays a key role range from Thomas Middleton s A Game at Chess to Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll to Vladimir Nabokov s The Defense to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig Chess has also featured in film classics such as Ingmar Bergman s The Seventh Seal Satyajit Ray s The Chess Players

Federation Tri Dimensional Chess and Wizard s Chess is played in J K Rowling s Harry Potter br br br Mathematics br br The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess such as the knight s tour and the eight queens puzzle have been known for hundreds of years br br The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be with a confidence level with a game tree complexity of approximately The game tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as a number known as the Shannon number An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves but there may be as few as zero in the case of checkmate or stalemate or in a constructed position as many as br In Ernst Zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory Zermelo s theorem states that it is possible to solve chess i e to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game either White can force a win or Black can force a win or both sides can force at least a draw With legal positions in chess however it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology br br br Psychology br There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal rather than visuospatial ability lies at the core of expertise In his doctoral thesis Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position According to de Groot this perception made possible by years of practice and study is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess playing skill since masters and novices when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces had equivalent recall about six positions in each case Rather it is the ability to recognize patterns which are then memorized which distinguished the skilled players from the novices When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game the masters had almost total positional recall br More recent research has focused on chess as mental training the respective roles of knowledge and look ahead search brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices blindfold chess the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill gender differences and computational models of chess expertise The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess Recent research however fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are also important br For example Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring Compared to the general population chess players are more likely to be non right handed though they found no correlation between handedness and skill br A relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in scientific literature as well as in popular culture Academic studies that investigate the relationship date back at least to Although one meta analysis and most children studies find a positive correlation between general cognitive ability and chess skill adult studies show mixed results br br br Composition br br Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems also called chess compositions The creator is known as a chess composer There are many types of chess problems the two most important are br br Directmates White to move first and checkmate Black within a specified number of moves against any defense These are often referred to as mate in n for example mate in three a three mover two and three move problems are the most common These usually involve positions that would be highly unlikely to occur in an actual game and are intended to illustrate a particular theme usually requiring a surprising or counterintuitive key move Themes associated with chess problems occasionally appear in actual games when they are referred to as problem like moves br Studies orthodox problems where the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw The majority of studies are endgame positions br Fairy chess is a branch of chess problem composition involving altered rules such as the use of unconventional pieces or boards or unusual stipulations such as reflexmates br Tournaments for composition and solving of chess problems are organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition which works cooperatively with but independent of FIDE The WFCC awards titles for composing and solving chess problems br br br Online chess br br Online chess is chess that is played over the internet allowing players to play against each other in real time This is done through the use of Internet chess servers which pair up individual players based on their rating using an Elo or similar
