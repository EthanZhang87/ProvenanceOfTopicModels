A rock band or pop band is a small musical ensemble that performs rock music pop music or a related genre A four piece band is the most common configuration in rock and pop music In the early years the configuration was typically two guitarists a lead guitarist and a rhythm guitarist with one of them singing lead vocals a bassist and a drummer e g the Beatles and KISS Another common formation is a vocalist who does not play an instrument electric guitarist bass guitarist and a drummer e g the Who the Monkees Led Zeppelin and U Sometimes in addition to electric guitars electric bass and drums also a keyboardist especially a pianist plays br Additionally rock and pop bands can also include boy bands or girl bands which many times have bands where the members do not play any instruments but sing and dance instead Such is the case of Menudo the Spice Girls and K pop bands for example br br br Etymology br The usage of band as group of musicians originated from to describe musicians attached to a regiment of the army and playing instruments which may be used while marching This word also used in to describe one man band for people who plays several musical instruments simultaneously br br br Two members br br Two member rock and pop bands such as the White Stripes Tenacious D the Black Keys Twenty One Pilots and Royal Blood are relatively rare because of the difficulty in providing all of the musical elements which are part of the rock or pop sound vocals chordal accompaniment bass lines and percussion or drumming Rock and pop duos typically omit one of these musical elements In many cases two member bands omit a drummer since guitars bass guitars and keyboards can all be used to provide a rhythmic pulse br Other examples of two member bands are MGMT WZRD Pet Shop Boys Hella Flight of the Conchords the Ting Tings They Might Be Giants from to and T Rex until shortly after scoring their UK breakthrough hit at which point they expanded to a four piece and more br When electronic sequencers became widely available in the s they made adding in musical elements easier for two member bands to perform Sequencers allowed bands to program some elements of their performance such as an electronic drum part and a synth bass line Two member pop music bands such as Soft Cell Blancmange and Yazoo used programmed sequencers Other pop bands from the s who were ostensibly fronted by two performers such as Wham Eurythmics and Tears for Fears were not actually two piece ensembles because other instrumental musicians were used behind the scenes to fill out the sound Modern bands that use this format include Ninja Sex Party In the s Local H continued on as a two piece when their bassist departed with guitarist singer Scott Lucas modifying his guitars by adding a bass pickup for the lower strings br Starting in the s blues influenced rock bands such as the White Stripes and the Black Keys used a guitar and drums scheme Death from Above featured a drummer and bass guitarist Tenacious D is a two guitar band One Day as a Lion and the Dresden Dolls both feature a keyboardist and a drummer Ratatat comprises a two guitar band that uses a drum machine for beats W A S P guitarist Doug Blair is also known for his work in the two piece progressive rock band Signal Noise where he acts as the lead guitarist and bassist at the same time due to a special custom instrument he invented an electric guitar with five regular guitar strings paired with three bass guitar strings Heisenflei of Los Angeles duo the Pity Party plays drums keyboards and sings simultaneously Royal Blood and The Garden are two piece bands that uses bass and drums along with electronic effects br br br Three members br br The smallest ensemble commonly used in rock music is the trio format In a hard rock or blues rock band or heavy metal rock group a power trio format is often used which consists of an electric guitar player an electric bass guitar player and a drummer and typically one or more of these musicians also sing sometimes all three members sing e g the Bee Gees or Alkaline Trio Some well known power trios with the guitarist on lead vocals are the Jimi Hendrix Experience Green Day Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble Nirvana and Muse br br A handful of others with the bassist on vocals include Thin Lizzy from to Primus Rush Mot rhead the Police and Cream br Some power trios feature two lead vocalists For example in the band Blink vocals are split between bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge or in the band Dinosaur Jr guitarist J Mascis is the primary songwriter and vocalist but bassist Lou Barlow writes some songs and sings as well br An alternative to the power trio is an organ trios formed with an electric guitarist a drummer and a keyboardist Although organ trios are most commonly associated with s and s jazz organ trio groups such as those led by organist Jimmy Smith organ trios also exist in rock oriented styles such as jazz rock fusion and Grateful Dead influenced jam bands for instance Medeski Martin Wood In organ trios the keyboard player typically plays a Hammond organ or similar instrument which permits the keyboard player to perform bass lines chords and lead lines A variant of the organ trio is a trio formed with an electric bassist a drummer and an electronic keyboardist playing synthesizers such as the progressive rock band Emerson Lake Palmer br A power trio with the guitarist on lead vocals is a popular record company lineup as the guitarist and singer usually are songwriters Therefore the label only has to present one face to the public The backing band may or may not be featured in publicity If the backup band is not marketed as an integral part of the group then the record company has more flexibility to replace band members or use substitute musicians This lineup often leads to songs that are fairly simple and accessible as the frontman has to sing and play guitar at the same time br br br Four members br br The four piece band is the most common configuration in rock and pop music Before the development of the electronic keyboard the configuration was typically two guitarists a bassist and a drummer e g The Beatles KISS Metallica Rise Against Weezer the Clash and the Smashing Pumpkins br Another common formation is a vocalist electric guitarist bass guitarist and a drummer e g Van Halen the Who Red Hot Chili Peppers Led Zeppelin and Blur Instrumentally these bands can be considered as trios br In some bands the guitarist could also be an occasional keyboardist like the Who the Smiths and Joy Division And some bands might have a keyboardist instead of a guitarist like Bastille and Future Islands br In some rock bands bassists could be occasional keyboardists like Led Zeppelin and R E M Keyboardists are used in place of bass performing with a guitarist singer and drummer for instance the Doors Some bands have a guitarist keyboard player bassist and drummer for example Talking Heads the Small Faces and Pink Floyd br Some bands have the bassist on lead vocals such as Thin Lizzy a four piece from onwards Pink Floyd Mot rhead as a four piece NOFX Skillet or even the lead guitarist such as Dire Straits Megadeth Weezer and Creedence Clearwater Revival Some bands such as the Beatles have a lead guitarist a rhythm guitarist and a bassist that all sing lead and backing vocals with those three playing and composing on keyboards regularly as well as a drummer Others such as the Four Seasons have a lead vocalist a lead guitarist a keyboard player and a bassist with the drummer not being a member of the band br br br Five members br br Five piece bands have existed in rock music since the development of the genre The Beach Boys Aerosmith AC DC and Oasis are examples of the common lineup of vocalist lead guitar rhythm guitar bass and drums An alternative lineup replaces the rhythm guitarist with a keyboard synthesizer player examples being the bands Yes Dream Theater Marilyn Manson and Deep Purple Another alternative replaces the rhythm guitarist with a turntablist such as in Deftones Incubus or Limp Bizkit br Further alternatives include a keyboardist guitarist drummer bassist and saxophonist such as the Sonics the Dave Clark and Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs Three guitarists may be present with a bassist and a drummer such as in the bands Radiohead Pearl Jam and the Byrds Some five person bands feature two guitarists a keyboardist a bassist and a drummer with one or more of these musicians typically one of the guitarists handling lead vocals on top of their instrument examples being Children of Bodom Styx Tally Hall and White Reaper The four piece arrangement can be augmented to five with a second drummer playing a separate full drumkit such as Adam and the Ants from onwards although other formations can also be expanded using two drummers such as Pink Fairies the Glitter Band Wizzard Sigue Sigue Sputnik Add N to X and Rialto br Other times the vocalist brings another musical voice to the table most commonly a harmonica or percussion Mick Jagger for example plays harmonica and percussion instruments such as maracas and tambourine in the Rolling Stones Ozzy Osbourne played the harmonica on some occasions with Black Sabbath Flutes may also be used by vocalists most notably Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull and Ray Thomas of the Moody Blues br br br Larger rock ensembles br br Larger bands have long been a part of rock and pop music in part due to the influence of the singer accompanied with orchestra model inherited from popular big band jazz and swing and popularized by Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald To create larger ensembles rock bands often add an additional guitarist an additional keyboardist additional percussionists or second drummer an entire horn section and even a flautist An example of a six member rock band is Toto with a lead vocalist guitarist bassist two keyboard players and drummer Other examples include Australian band INXS and American Blondie both consist of a lead vocalist two guitarists a keyboard player a bassist and a drummer The American heavy metal band Slipknot is composed of nine members with a vocalist two guitarists a drummer a bassist two custom percussionists a turntablist and a sampler Brazilian band Tit s currently a three man band had as many as eight members in the late s with three lead singers two guitarists bassist keyboard player and drummer br In larger groups such as the Band instrumentalists could play multiple instruments which enabled the ensemble to create a wider variety of instrument combinations More modern examples of such a band are Arcade Fire and the Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros More rarely rock or pop groups are accompanied in concerts by a full or partial symphony orchestra where lush string orchestra arrangements are used to flesh out the sound of slow ballads Rhys Chatham and Glenn Branca started doing performances in the late s with orchestras consisting of to Branca and even guitars Some groups have a large number of members who all play the same instrument such as guitar keyboard horns or strings br br br Role of women br br Women have a high prominence in many popular music styles as singers However professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in popular music especially in rock genres such as heavy metal P laying in a band is largely a male homosocial activity that is learning to play in a band is largely a peer based experience shaped by existing sex segregated friendship networks As well rock music is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis vis female bedroom culture In popular music a gendered distinction between public male and private female participation in music has existed S everal scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands rehearsals recordings performances and other social activities Women are mainly regarded as passive and private consumers of allegedly slick prefabricated hence inferior pop music excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians One of the reasons that mixed gender bands rarely exist is that bands operate as tight knit units in which homosocial solidarity social bonds between people of the same sex plays a crucial role In the s pop music scene s inging was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl but playing an instrument simply wasn t done br The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion the women often in the s and s girls in their teens in rock usually sang songs as person utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends Philip Auslander says that Although there were many women in rock by the late s most performed only as singers a traditionally feminine position in popular music Though some women played instruments in American all female garage rock bands none of these bands achieved more than regional success So they did not provide viable templates for women s on going participation in rock In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands it has been said that h eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male a t least until the mid s apart from exceptions such as Girlschool However now in the s maybe more than ever strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it carv ing out a considerable place for them selves br When Suzi Quatro emerged in no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer instrumentalist songwriter and bandleader According to Auslander she was kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female musician and this is a point I am extremely concerned about could play as well if not better than the boys br br br Variable lineups br Many bands maintain different but consistent lineups for studio recording vs live performances Toxic Holocaust for instance consisted entirely of a single member within the recording studio for the first years of their existence but still toured as a band with supplementary members on stage For decades Genesis maintained two consistent lineups Tony Banks Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins in the studio with Chester Thompson and Daryl Stuermer always additionally appearing as band members in live performances br br br See also br br Side project a band containing a person or persons
