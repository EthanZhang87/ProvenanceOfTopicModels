initially bored by it but is excited to learn that she drew cartoons with punch lines like he does br A few minutes later just when he and Breckenridge enter gym class Principal Nichols announces that a gas leak has occurred and allows the students to have a surprise recess Nate takes a break from Breckenridge to play football with his friends and a kid named Roderick but is soon forced by Nichols to be with Breckenridge again to his dismay br Over the course of the week being Breckenridge s buddy begins to exhaust Nate who still feels like he remembers Breckenridge The next day back at school

scavenger hunt and even though Breckenridge is initially uninterested he decides to join Nate s team Just as Nate is about to go to BBC he thinks about leaving Breckenridge again but a combination of guilt and Principal Nichols spying on him makes him change his mind During the Breakfast Book Club meeting everyone reads Edna Birkdale s journal except for Breckenridge who is reading a plant book as the journal wasn t appealing to him with one note from the journal in particular standing out It says there was a mural in the school s old south stairwell which Ms Hickson theorizes was destroyed over the years Nate s nemesis Gina criticizes the meeting once it s over calling comics lame with particularly strong criticism directed at Nate since he has a passion for them Nate realizes that he himself was criticizing Breckenridge s love for plants and criticizing him for loving it With that Nate starts to be more accepting of Breckenridge br During social studies Nate s teacher Ms Godfrey finds Breckenridge s desk covered with drawings and graffiti and forces him and Nate to clean it up oblivious that Randy Betancourt and his posse did it and framed Nate and Breckenridge However she doesn t give them detentions allowing them to go to the Doodler s meeting after school during the meeting Breckenridge shows interest in a painting of flowers made by an artist named Granny Peppers The gang also expresses curiousness for Granny Peppers paintings the fact being that one was sold for br While on the way home Nate and his gang try to think about how Granny Peppers got her nickname culminating in Breckenridge recalling a nickname he had when he was younger Bobby At this Nate immediately recognizes the name AND Breckenridge As it turns out when Nate was in preschool a kid named Bobby used to pick on him for months This Bobby person was none other than Breckenridge Upon realizing as much Nate snaps at Breckenridge and walks off br When Nate gets home he is visited by Dee Dee who wants to know what just happened As Nate explains everything Dee Dee asks Nate to forgive Breckenridge When he is unsure Dee Dee invites Breckenridge into Nate s room Nate tells Breckenridge that the reason he didn t connect with him was the fact that they have little in common but befriends him after Dee Dee points out that she likes cats figure skating and egg salad things Nate despises very much yet he s still friends with her br Now officially considering Breckenridge a friend Nate includes him in his scavenger hunt team During the day of the centennial teams including Nate s and Gina s are in instructed to find items relating to the school s history The first item on Nate s list is a desk with an inkwell which they find in the English room due to Breckenridge recognizing a spider plant in one of the desks Eventually they make to their th and final item something that will improve PS br They search the school s storage room for something but find nothing until Breckenridge finds a wall with flowers painted over Teddy brushes it off as graffiti but Nate realizes that the flowers might be part of the mural described by Edna Birkdale as the storage room could be in place of the former south stairwell from the school s original design To make things even more astounding Breckenridge deduces that it was painted by Granny Peppers since the flowers were painted the same as the painting in the Art room With this information Nate rushes to find Principal Nichols and finds him just as Gina s team does Gina s team presents a suggestion box while Nate says he couldn t bring it with him Gina s team thinks this is an excuse and taunt Nate for not having anything to present but Nate asks Principal Nichols to follow him to witness the mural in the story br Breckenridge s theory ends up correct with Nate Principal Nichols and the rest of the gang live on TV interviewed on how they found the long lost mural After interviewing Breckenridge the reporter asks Nichols what made the mural s discovery so significant Nichols then reveals that the mural was Granny Pepper s only mural Due to its significance and rarity PS is donating it to a museum who will be offering money to restore the PS building The gang go to see the mural which is exactly how Edna said it was years ago And thus because of Breckenridge Nate s team won the scavenger hunt with the prize
