id: 10272
An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes unlike a standard acoustic guitar It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities from that of an acoustic guitar via amplifier settings or knobs on the guitar Often this is done through the use of effects such as reverb distortion and overdrive the latter is considered to be a key element of electric blues guitar music and jazz rock and heavy metal guitar playing Designs also exist combining attributes of the electric and acoustic guitars the semi acoustic and acoustic electric guitars br Invented in the electric guitar was adopted by jazz guitar players who wanted to play single note guitar solos in large big band ensembles Early proponents of the electric guitar on record include Les Paul Eddie Durham George Barnes Lonnie Johnson Sister Rosetta Tharpe T Bone Walker and Charlie Christian During the s and s the electric guitar became the most important instrument in popular music It has evolved into an instrument that is capable of a multitude of sounds and styles in genres ranging from pop and rock to folk to country music blues and jazz It served as a major component in the development of electric blues rock and roll rock music heavy metal music and many other genres of music br Electric guitar design and construction varies greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck bridge and pickups Guitars may have a fixed bridge or a spring loaded hinged bridge which lets players bend the pitch of notes or chords up or down or perform vibrato effects The sound of an electric guitar can be modified by new playing techniques such as string bending tapping and hammering on using audio feedback or slide guitar playing br There are several types of electric guitar Early forms were hollow body semi acoustic guitars while solid body guitars developed later String configurations include the six string guitar the most common type which is usually tuned E A D G B E from lowest to highest strings the seven string guitar which typically adds a low B string below the low E the eight string guitar which typically adds a low E or F string below the low B and the twelve string guitar which has six two string courses similar to a mandolin br In rock the electric guitar is often used in two roles as a rhythm guitar which plays the chord sequences or progressions and riffs and sets the beat as part of a rhythm section and as a lead guitar which provides instrumental melody lines melodic instrumental fill passages and solos In a small group such as a power trio one guitarist may switch between both roles in larger groups there is often a rhythm guitarist and a lead guitarist br br Many experiments with electrically amplifying the vibrations of a string instrument were made dating back to the early part of the th century Patents from the s show telephone transmitters were adapted and placed inside violins and banjos to amplify the sound Hobbyists in the s used carbon button microphones attached to the bridge however these detected vibrations from the bridge on top of the instrument resulting in a weak signal br Electric guitars were originally designed by acoustic guitar makers and instrument manufacturers The demand for amplified guitars began during the big band era as orchestras increased in size guitar players soon realized the necessity in guitar amplification and electrification The first electric guitars used in jazz were hollow archtop acoustic guitar bodies with electromagnetic transducers br The first electrically amplified stringed instrument to be marketed commercially was a cast aluminium lap steel guitar nicknamed the Frying Pan designed in by George Beauchamp the general manager of the National Stringed Instrument Corporation with Paul Barth who was vice president George Beauchamp along with Adolph Rickenbacker invented the electromagnetic pickups Coils that were wrapped around a magnet would create an electromagnetic field that converted the vibrations of the guitar strings into electrical signals which could then be amplified Commercial production began in late summer of by the Ro Pat In Corporation Electro Patent Instrument Company in Los Angeles a partnership of Beauchamp Adolph Rickenbacker originally Rickenbacher and Paul Barth br In the company was renamed the Rickenbacker Electro Stringed Instrument Company In that year Beauchamp applied for a United States patent for an Electrical Stringed Musical Instrument and the patent was later issued in By the time it was patented other manufacturers were already making their own electric guitar designs Early electric guitar manufacturers include Rickenbacker in Dobro in National AudioVox and Volu tone in Vega Epiphone Electrophone and Electar and Gibson in and many others by br br By early mid Electro String Instrument Corporation had achieved success with the Frying Pan and set out to capture a new audience through its release of the Electro Spanish Model B and the Electro Spanish Ken Roberts which was the first full inch scale electric guitar ever produced The Electro Spanish Ken Roberts was revolutionary for its time providing players a full inch scale with easy access to frets free of the body Unlike other lap steel electrified instruments produced during the time the Electro Spanish Ken Roberts was designed to play while standing upright with the guitar on a strap as with acoustic guitars The Electro Spanish Ken Roberts was also the first instrument to feature a hand operated vibrato as a standard arrangement a device called the Vibrola invented by Doc Kauffman br It is estimated that fewer than Electro Spanish Ken Roberts were constructed between and fewer than are known to survive today br The solid body electric guitar is made of solid wood without functionally resonating air spaces The first solid body Spanish standard guitar was offered by Vivi Tone no later than This model featured a guitar shaped body of a single sheet of plywood affixed to a wood frame Another early substantially solid Spanish electric guitar called the Electro Spanish was marketed by the Rickenbacker guitar company in and made of Bakelite By the Slingerland company introduced a wooden solid body electric model the Slingerland Songster and a lap steel counterpart the Songster br Gibson s first production electric guitar marketed in was the ES model ES for Electric Spanish and reflecting the price of the instrument along with matching amplifier The ES guitar featured a single coil hexagonally shaped bar pickup which was designed by Walt Fuller It became known as the Charlie Christian pickup named for the jazz guitarist who was among the first to perform with the ES guitar The ES achieved some popularity but suffered from unequal loudness across the six strings br A functioning solid body electric guitar was designed and built in by Les Paul from an Epiphone acoustic archtop as an experiment His log guitar a wood post with a neck attached and two hollow body halves attached to the sides for appearance only shares nothing in common for design or hardware with the solid body Gibson Les Paul designed by Ted McCarty and introduced in br The feedback associated with amplified hollow bodied electric guitars was understood long before Paul s log was created in Gage Brewer s Ro Pat In of had a top so heavily reinforced that it essentially functioned as a solid body instrument br br Unlike acoustic guitars solid body electric guitars have no vibrating soundboard to amplify string vibration Instead solid body instruments depend on electric pickups and an amplifier amp and speaker The solid body ensures that the amplified sound reproduces the string vibration alone thus avoiding the wolf tones and unwanted feedback associated with amplified acoustic guitars These guitars are generally made of hardwood covered with a hard polymer finish often polyester or lacquer In large production facilities the wood is stored for three to six months in a wood drying kiln before being cut to shape Premium custom built guitars are frequently made with much older hand selected wood br One of the first solid body guitars was invented by Les Paul Gibson did not present their Gibson Les Paul guitar prototypes to the public as they did not believe the solid body style would catch on Another early solid body Spanish style guitar resembling what would become Gibson s Les Paul guitar a decade later was developed in by O W Appleton of Nogales Arizona Appleton made contact with both Gibson and Fender but was unable to sell the idea behind his App guitar to either company In Merle Travis commissioned steel guitar builder Paul Bigsby to build him a solid body Spanish style electric Bigsby delivered the guitar in The first mass produced solid body guitar was Fender Esquire and Fender Broadcaster later to become the Fender Telecaster first made in five years after Les Paul made his prototype The Gibson Les Paul appeared soon after to compete with the Broadcaster Another notable solid body design is the Fender Stratocaster which was introduced in and became extremely popular among musicians in the s and s for its wide tonal capabilities and more comfortable ergonomics than other models Different styles of guitar have different pick up styles the main being or single coil pick ups or a double humbucker with the Stratocaster being a triple single coil guitar br The history of electric guitars has been summarized by Guitar World magazine and the earliest electric guitar on their top list is the Ro Pat In Electro A Frying Pan described as The first fully functioning solid body electric guitar to be manufactured and sold It was the first electric guitar used in a publicly promoted performance performed by Gage Brewer in Wichita Kansas in October The most recent electric guitar on this list was the Ibanez Jem which featured frets an impossibly thin neck and was designed to be the ultimate shredder machine Numerous other important electric guitars are on the list including Gibson ES Fender Telecaster Gibson Les Paul Gretsch Duo Jet Fender Stratocaster Rickenbacker Van Halen Frankenstrat Paul Reed Smith Custom many of these guitars were successors to earlier designs Electric guitar designs eventually became culturally important and visually iconic with various model companies selling miniature model versions of particularly famous electric guitars for example the Gibson SG used by Angus Young from the group AC DC br br Some otherwise solid bodied guitars such as the Gibson Les Paul Supreme the PRS Singlecut and the Fender Telecaster Thinline are built with hollow chambers in the body These chambers are designed to not interfere with the critical bridge and string anchor point on the solid body In the case of Gibson and PRS these are called chambered bodies The motivation for this may be to reduce weight to achieve a semi acoustic tone see below or both br br Semi acoustic guitars have a hollow body similar to an acoustic guitar and electromagnetic pickups mounted directly into the body They work in a similar way to solid body electric guitars except that because the hollow body also vibrates the pickups convert a combination of string and body vibration into an electrical signal Many models known as semi hollow bodies have a solid block running through the middle of the soundbox designed to reduce acoustic feedback They do not provide enough acoustic volume for live performance but they can be used unplugged for quiet practice Semi acoustic guitars are noted for being able to provide a sweet plaintive or funky tone They are used in many genres including jazz blues funk sixties pop and indie rock They generally have cello style F shaped sound holes which can be blocked off to further reduce feedback Whereas chambered guitars are made like solid body guitars from a single block of wood semi acoustic guitar bodies are made from multiple pieces of wood in an archtop form a method of construction different from the typical steel string acoustic guitar The top is formed from a moderately thick piece of wood which is then carved into a thin outward curving shape whereas conventional acoustic guitars have a thin flat top br br Some steel string acoustic guitars include a built in system to electrically amplify their output without altering their tone as an alternative to using a separate microphone The system may consist of piezoelectric pickups mounted under the bridge or a low mass microphone usually a condenser mic inside the body of the guitar that converts the vibrations in the body into electronic signals Combinations of these types of pickups may be used with an integral mixer preamp graphic equalizer Such instruments are called electric acoustic guitars They are regarded as acoustic guitars rather than electric guitars because the pickups do not produce a signal directly from the vibration of the strings but rather from the vibration of the guitar top or body and the amplification of the sound merely increases volume not alters tone br br Electric guitar design and construction vary greatly in the shape of the body and the configuration of the neck bridge and pickups However some features are present on most guitars The photo below shows the different parts of an electric guitar The headstock contains the metal machine heads which use a worm gear for tuning The nut a thin fret like strip of metal plastic graphite or bone supports the strings at the headstock end of the instrument The frets are thin metal strips that stop the string at the correct pitch when the player pushes a string against the fingerboard The truss rod is a metal rod usually adjustable that counters the tension of the strings to keep the neck straight Position markers provide the player with a reference to the playing position on the fingerboard br The neck and fretboard extend from the body At the neck joint the neck is either glued or bolted to the body The body is typically made of wood with a hard polymerized finish Strings vibrating in the magnetic field of the pickups produce an electric current in the pickup winding that passes through the tone and volume controls to the output jack Some guitars have piezo pickups in addition to or instead of magnetic pickups br Some guitars have a fixed bridge Others have a spring loaded hinged bridge called a vibrato bar tremolo bar or whammy bar which lets players bend notes or chords up or down in pitch or perform a vibrato embellishment A plastic pickguard on some guitars protects the body from scratches or covers the control cavity which holds most of the wiring br The degree to which the choice of woods and other materials in the solid guitar body affects the sonic character of the amplified signal is disputed Many believe it is highly significant while others think the difference between woods is subtle In acoustic and archtop guitars wood choices more clearly affect tone br Woods typically used in solid body electric guitars include alder brighter but well rounded swamp ash similar to alder but with more pronounced highs and lows mahogany dark bassy warm poplar similar to alder and basswood very neutral Maple a very bright tonewood is also a popular body wood but is very heavy For this reason it is often placed as a cap on a guitar made primarily of another wood Cheaper guitars are often made of cheaper woods such as plywood pine or agathis not true hardwoods which can affect durability and tone Though most guitars are made of wood any material may be used Materials such as plastic metal and even cardboard have been used in some instruments br The guitar output jack typically provides a monaural signal Many guitars with active electronics use a jack with an extra contact normally used for stereo These guitars use the extra contact to break the ground connection to the on board battery to preserve battery life when the guitar is unplugged These guitars require a mono plug to close the internal switch and connect the battery to ground Standard guitar cables use a high impedance inch mm mono plug These have a tip and sleeve configuration referred to as a TS phone connector The voltage is usually around to millivolts br A few guitars such as Rickenbacker guitars equipped with Rick O Sound feature stereo output There are a variety of ways the stereo effect may be implemented Commonly but not exclusively stereo guitars route the neck and bridge pickups to separate output buses on the guitar A stereo cable then routes each pickup to its signal chain or amplifier For these applications the most popular connector is a high impedance inch mm plug with a tip ring and sleeve configuration also known as a TRS phone connector Some studio instruments notably certain Gibson Les Paul models incorporate a low impedance three pin XLR connector for balanced audio Many exotic arrangements and connectors exist that support features such as midi and hexaphonic pickups br br The bridge and tailpiece while serving separate purposes work closely together to affect playing style and tone There are four basic types of bridge and tailpiece systems on electric guitars Within these four types are many variants br A hard tail guitar bridge anchors the strings at or directly behind the bridge and is fastened securely to the top of the instrument These are common on carved top guitars such as the Gibson Les Paul and the Paul Reed Smith models and on slab body guitars such as the Music Man Albert Lee and Fender guitars that are not equipped with a vibrato arm br A floating or trapeze tailpiece similar to a violin s fastens to the body at the base of the guitar These appear on Rickenbackers Gretsches Epiphones a wide variety of archtop guitars particularly jazz guitars and the Gibson Les Paul br br Pictured is a tremolo arm or vibrato tailpiece style bridge and tailpiece system often called a whammy bar or trem It uses a lever vibrato arm attached to the bridge that can temporarily slacken or tighten the strings to alter the pitch A player can use this to create a vibrato or a portamento effect Early vibrato systems were often unreliable and made the guitar go out of tune easily They also had a limited pitch range Later Fender designs were better but Fender held the patent on these so other companies used older designs for many years br With the expiration of the Fender patent on the Stratocaster style vibrato various improvements on this type of internal multi spring vibrato system are now available Floyd Rose introduced one of the first improvements on the vibrato system in many years when in the late s he experimented with locking nuts and bridges that prevent the guitar from losing tuning even under heavy vibrato bar use br br The fourth type of system employs string through body anchoring The strings pass over the bridge saddles then through holes through the top of the guitar body to the back The strings are typically anchored in place at the back of the guitar by metal ferrules Many believe this design improves a guitar s sustain and timbre A few examples of string through body guitars are the Fender Telecaster Thinline the Fender Telecaster Deluxe the B C Rich IT Warlock and Mockingbird and the Schecter Omen and series br br Compared to an acoustic guitar which has a hollow body electric guitars make much less audible sound when their strings are plucked so electric guitars are normally plugged into a guitar amplifier and speaker When an electric guitar is played string movement produces a signal by generating i e inducing a small electric current in the magnetic pickups which are magnets wound with coils of very fine wire br The signal passes through the tone and volume circuits to the output jack and through a cable to an amplifier The current induced is proportional to such factors as string density and the amount of movement over the pickups br Because of their natural qualities magnetic pickups tend to pick up ambient usually unwanted electromagnetic interference or EMI This mains hum results in a tone of or cycles per second depending on the powerline frequency of the local alternating current supply br The resulting hum is particularly strong with single coil pickups Double coil or humbucker pickups were invented as a way to reduce or counter the sound as they are designed to buck in the verb sense of oppose or resist the hum hence their name The high combined inductance of the two coils also leads to the richer fatter tone associated with humbucking pickups br br Electric guitar necks vary in composition and shape The primary metric of guitar necks is the scale length which is the vibrating length of the strings from nut to bridge A typical Fender guitar uses a inch cm scale length while Gibson uses a inch cm scale length in their Les Paul While the scale length of the Les Paul is often described as inches it has varied through the years by as much as a half inch br Frets are positioned proportionally to scale length the shorter the scale length the closer the fret spacing Opinions vary regarding the effect of scale length on tone and feel Popular opinion holds that longer scale length contributes to greater amplitude Reports of playing feel are greatly complicated by the many factors involved in this perception String gauge and design neck construction and relief guitar setup playing style and other factors contribute to the subjective impression of playability or feel br br Necks are described as bolt on set in or neck through depending on how they attach to the body Set in necks are glued to the body at the factory This is the traditional type of joint Leo Fender pioneered bolt on necks on electric guitars to facilitate easy adjustment and replacement Neck through instruments extend the neck to the length of the instrument so that it forms the center of the body While a set in neck can be carefully unglued by a skilled luthier and a bolt on neck can simply be unscrewed a neck through design is difficult or even impossible to repair depending on the damage Historically the bolt on style has been more popular for ease of installation and adjustment Since bolt on necks can be easily removed there is an after market in replacement bolt on necks from companies such as Warmoth and Mighty Mite Some instruments notably most Gibson models continue to use set in glued necks Neck through bodies are somewhat more common in bass guitars br Materials for necks are selected for dimensional stability and rigidity and some allege that they influence tone Hardwoods are preferred with maple mahogany and ash topping the list The neck and fingerboard can be made from different materials for example a guitar may have a maple neck with a rosewood or ebony fingerboard Today there are expensive and budget guitars exploring other options for fretboard wood for instance Pau Ferro both for availability and cheap price while still maintaining quality In the s designers began to use exotic human made materials such as aircraft grade aluminum carbon fiber and ebonol Makers known for these unusual materials include John Veleno Travis Bean Geoff Gould and Alembic br br Aside from possible engineering advantages some feel that with the rising cost of rare tonewoods human made materials may be economically preferable and more ecologically sensitive However wood remains popular in production instruments though sometimes in conjunction with new materials Vigier guitars for example use a wooden neck reinforced by embedding a light carbon fiber rod in place of the usual heavier steel bar or adjustable steel truss rod After market necks made entirely from carbon fiber fit existing bolt on instruments Few if any extensive formal investigations have been widely published that confirm or refute claims over the effects of different woods or materials on the electric guitar sound br br Several neck shapes appear on guitars including shapes known as C necks U necks and V necks These refer to the cross sectional shape of the neck especially near the nut Several sizes of fret wire are available with traditional players often preferring thin frets and metal shredders liking thick frets Thin frets are considered better for playing chords while thick frets allow lead guitarists to bend notes with less effort br An electric guitar with a folding neck called the Foldaxe was designed and built for Chet Atkins by Roger C Field Steinberger guitars developed a line of exotic carbon fiber instruments without headstocks with tuning done on the bridge instead br Fingerboards vary as much as necks The fingerboard surface usually has a cross sectional radius that is optimized to accommodate finger movement for different playing techniques Fingerboard radius typically ranges from nearly flat a very large radius to radically arched a small radius The vintage Fender Telecaster for example has a typical small radius of approximately inches cm Some manufacturers have experimented with fret profile and material fret layout number of frets and modifications of the fingerboard surface for various reasons Some innovations were intended to improve playability by ergonomic means such as Warmoth Guitars compound radius fingerboard Scalloped fingerboards added enhanced microtonality during fast legato runs Fanned frets intend to provide each string with an optimal playing tension and enhanced musicality Some guitars have no frets while others like the Gittler guitar have no neck in the traditional sense
