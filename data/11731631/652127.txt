Mexicans Spanish Mexicanos are the citizens and nationals of the United Mexican States The Mexican people have varied origins with the most spoken language being Spanish but many also speak languages from different Indigenous linguistic groups and other languages brought to Mexico by expatriates or recent immigration In of Mexico s population identified as Indigenous There are currently about million Mexican nationals residing outside Mexico with about million living in the United States The larger Mexican diaspora can also include individuals that trace ancestry to Mexico and self identify as Mexican but are not necessarily Mexican by citizenship The United States has the largest Mexican population in the world after Mexico at in br The modern nation of Mexico achieved independence from the Spanish Empire in after a decade long war for independence starting in this began the process of forging a national identity that fused the cultural traits of Indigenous pre Columbian origin with those of Spanish and African ancestry This led to what has been termed a peculiar form of multi ethnic nationalism which was more invigorated and developed after the Mexican Revolution when the Constitution of officially established Mexico as an indivisible pluricultural nation founded on its indigenous roots br br br History and Definitions br br Mexicano Mexican is derived from the word Mexico itself In the principal model to create demonyms in Spanish the suffix ano is added to the name of the place of origin However in Nahuatl language the original demonym becomes Mexica The area that is now modern day Mexico has cradled many predecessor civilizations going back as far as the Olmec which influenced the latter civilizations of Teotihuacan BC to AD and the much debated Toltec people who flourished around the th and th centuries AD and ending with the last great indigenous civilization before the The Nahuatl language was a common tongue in the region of modern Central Mexico during the Aztec Empire but after the arrival of Europeans and the Spanish Conquest the conquest of the Aztec empire March to August the common language of the region became Spanish br The Spanish re administered the land and expanded their own empire beyond the former boundaries of the Aztec adding more territory to the Mexican sphere of influence which remained under the Spanish Crown for years It has been suggested that the name of the country is derived from Mextli or M xihtli a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Mexicas Huitzilopochtli in which case M xihco means Place where Huitzilopochtli lives Another hypothesis suggests that M xihco derives from the Nahuatl words for Moon M tztli and navel x ctli This meaning Place at the Center of the Moon might then refer to Tenochtitlan s position in the middle of Lake Texcoco The system of interconnected lakes of which Texcoco formed the center had the form of a rabbit which the Mesoamericans pareidolically associated with the Moon Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from M ctli the goddess of maguey br br br Ethnic groups br br br Mestizo Mexicans br br The majority of Mexicans have varying degrees of Spanish and Mesoamerican ancestry and have been classified as Mestizos In the modern meaning of the term this means that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a Spanish cultural heritage but rather identify with the uniquely Mexican identity which incorporates elements from both Spanish and indigenous traditions By the deliberate efforts of post revolutionary governments the Mestizo identity was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as mestizaje mesti saxe Mexican politicians and reformers such as Jos Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity based on the aforementioned cultural policies which were designed with the main goal of helping indigenous peoples to achieve the same level of progress as the rest of society by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo ones eventually assimilating them into the Mestizo Mexican society br br Since the Mestizo identity promoted by the government is more of a cultural identity it has achieved a strong influence in the country and has caused many people who may not qualify as Mestizos in its original sense to be counted as such in Mexico s demographic investigations and censuses with many people who may be considered White being historically classified as Mestizos A similar situation occurs regarding the distinctions between Indigenous peoples and Mestizos while the term Mestizo is sometimes used in English with the meaning of a person with mixed indigenous and European blood this usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure Indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language and a person with none or a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage In the Yucat n peninsula the word Mestizo has a different meaning with it being to refer to the Maya speaking populations living in traditional communities because during the caste war of the late th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as Mestizos In Chiapas the word Ladino is used instead of mestizo br br Given that the word Mestizo has different implications in certain areas of Mexico estimates of the Mexican Mestizo population vary widely According to the Encyclop dia Britannica which uses a biology based approach about three fifths of the Mexican population is Mestizo A culture based criteria estimates the percentage of Mestizos as high as Paradoxically the word Mestizo has long been dropped from popular Mexican vocabulary with the word even having pejorative connotations further complicating attempts to quantify Mestizos via self identification recent research based on self identification indeed has observed that many Mexicans do not actually identify as mestizos and would not agree to be labeled as such with static racial labels such as White Indian Black etc being more commonly used br While for most of its history the concept of Mestizo and mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico s intellectual circles in recent times the concept has been target of criticism with its detractors claiming that it delegitimizes the importance of race in Mexico under the idea of racism not existing here in Mexico as everybody is Mestizo In general the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole br br br White Mexicans br br White Mexicans are Mexican citizens who trace all or most of their ancestry to Europe Europeans began arriving in Mexico during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and while during the colonial period most European immigration was Spanish in the th and th centuries European and European derived populations from North and South America did immigrate to the country According to th and st century academics large scale intermixing between the European immigrants and the native indigenous peoples would produce a Mestizo group which would become the overwhelming majority of Mexico s population by the time of independence However according to church registers from the colonial times the majority of Spanish men married with Spanish women Said registers also put in question other narratives held by contemporary academics such as European immigrants who arrived to Mexico being almost exclusively men or that pure Spanish people were all part of a small powerful elite as Spaniards were often the most numerous ethnic group in the colonial cities and there were menial workers and people in poverty who were of complete Spanish origin br br Estimates of Mexico s white population differ greatly in both methodology and percentages given Extra official sources such as the CIA World Factbook which use the census results as the base of their estimations calculate Mexico s white population as only the results of the census however have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate whereas Encyclop dia Britannica estimates them at around Field surveys that account for phenotypical traits suggest higher percentages using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as white the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at with a similar methodology the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of having its higher frequency on the North region followed by the Center region and the South region Another study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico s National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are and respectively surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico s National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico s National Institute of Statistics and Geography report percentages that range from to The use of skin color palettes as the primary criteria to estimate the ethnoracial groups that inhabit a given country has its origin in the investigations produced by Princeton and Vanderbilt Universities which found it to be more accurate than self identification particularly in Latin America where the different discourses that exist in regards to national identity have rendered previous attempts to estimate ethnic groups unreliable br Mexico s northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European population with the majority of the people not having native admixture or being of predominantly European ancestry In the north and west of Mexico the indigenous tribes were substantially smaller and unlike those found in central and southern Mexico they were mostly nomadic therefore remaining isolated from colonial population centers with hostilities between them and Mexican colonists often taking place This eventually led the northeast region of the country to become the region with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period albeit this has been changing in recent years as Mexicans from southern regions migrate to the north br br br Indigenous Mexicans br br The General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples recognizes indigenous languages as national languages which have the same validity as Spanish in all territories in which they are spoken The recognition of indigenous languages and the protection of indigenous cultures is granted not only to the ethnic groups indigenous to modern day Mexican territory but also to other North American indigenous groups that migrated to Mexico from the United States such as the Kikap in the th century and those who immigrated from Guatemala in the s The category of indigena indigenous in Mexico has been defined based on different criteria through history this means that the percentage of the Mexican population defined as indigenous varies according to the definition applied It can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak an indigenous language Based on this criterion approximately of the population is Indigenous Nonetheless activists for the rights of indigenous peoples have referred to the usage of this criterion for census purposes as statistical genocide br br Other surveys made by the Mexican government do count as Indigenous all persons who speak an indigenous language and people who do not speak indigenous languages nor live in indigenous communities but self identifies as Indigenous According to this criterion the National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples Comisi n Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Ind genas or CDI in Spanish and the INEGI Mexico s National Institute of Statistics and Geography stated that there are million indigenous people in Mexico of many different ethnic groups which constitute of the population in the country According to the latest intercensal survey carried out by the Mexican government in Indigenous people make up of Mexico s population In this occasion people who self identified as Indigenous and people who self identified as partially Indigenous were classified in the Indigenous category altogether In the Mexican census of the country s population self identified as indigenous and were reported to live in Indigenous households br br The absolute indigenous population is growing but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples is nonetheless falling The majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central southern and south eastern states with the majority of the indigenous population living in rural areas Some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of usos y costumbres usages and customs which allows them to regulate some internal issues under customary law br According to the CDI the states with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are Yucat n with Quintana Roo with and Campeche with of the population being indigenous most of them Maya Oaxaca with of the population the most numerous groups being the Mixtec and Zapotec peoples Chiapas has the majority being Tzeltal and Tzotzil Maya Hidalgo with the majority being Otomi Puebla with and Guerrero with mostly Nahua people and the states of San Luis Potos and Veracruz both home to a population of indigenous people mostly from the Totonac Nahua and Teenek Huastec groups br br br Afro Mexicans br br Afro Mexicans are an ethnic group that predominate in certain areas of Mexico such as the Costa Chica of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero Veracruz e g Yanga and in some towns in northern Mexico mainly in M zquiz Municipality Coahuila The existence of individuals of African descent in Mexico has its origins in the slave trade that took place during colonial times and that did not end until Historically the prescence of this ethnic group within the country has been difficult to assess for a number of reasons their small numbers heavy intermarriage with other ethnic groups and Mexico s tradition of defining itself as a Mestizo society or mixing of European and indigenous only Nowadays this ethnic group also includes recent immigrants from Africa the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Americas br The majority of Mexico s Afro descendants are Afromestizos i e mixed race According to the intercensal survey carried out in of the population self identified as Afro Mexican with of them also identifying as indigenous and being speakers of indigenous languages In the census survey carried out by the Mexican government Afro Mexicans were reported to make up of the country s population br br br Other ethno cultural communities br br br Jewish Mexicans br br A Jewish specifically Sephardic population has existed in Mexico since the start of the Spanish invasion and occupation of Mexico The current Jewish population in Mexico mostly consists of those who have descended from immigrants from the th and early th centuries with nationwide totals estimated between and about of whom are in Mexico City The exact numbers are not known One main source for figures is the Comit Central Israelita in Mexico City but its contact is limited to Orthodox and Conservative congregations with no contact with Jews that may be affiliated with the Reform movement or those who consider themselves secular The Mexican government census lists religion but its categories are confusing confusing those of some Protestant sects which practice Judaic rituals with Jewish groups There is also controversy as to whether to count those crypto Jews who have converted back to Judaism Sixty two percent of the population over fifteen is married three percent divorced and four percent widowed However younger Jewish women are more likely to be employed outside the home only of women are housewives and fertility rates are dropping from children of women over to for the overall population now There is a low level of intermarriage with the general Mexican population with only of marriages being mixed Although the Jewish community is less than one percent of Mexico s total population Mexico is one of the few countries whose Jewish population is expected to grow br br br German Mexicans br br German Mexicans German Deutschmexikaner or Deutsch Mexikanisch Spanish germano mexicano or alem n mexicano are Mexicans of German descent or origin br Most ethnic Germans arrived in Mexico during the mid to late th century spurred by government policies of Porfirio D az Although a good number of them took advantage of the liberal policies then valid in Mexico and went into merchant industrial and educational ventures others arrived with no or limited capital as employees or farmers Most settled in Mexico City Veracruz Yucat n and Puebla Significant numbers of German immigrants also arrived during and after the First and Second World Wars The Plautdietsch language is also spoken by the Mexican Mennonites descendants of German and Dutch immigrants in the states of Chihuahua Durango Zacatecas and Aguascalientes Other German towns lie in the states of Nuevo Le n Jalisco Sinaloa Yucat n Chiapas Quintana Roo and other parts of Puebla where the German culture and language have been preserved to different extents br The German Mexican community has largely integrated into Mexican society as a whole whilst retaining some cultural traits and in turn exerted cultural and industrial influences on Mexican society Especially after the First World War intense processes of transculturation can be observed particularly in Mexico City Jalisco Nuevo Le n Puebla and notably with the Maya in Chiapas These include social cultural and identity aspects br br br Arab Mexicans br br An Arab Mexican is a Mexican citizen of Arab origin who can be of various ancestral origins The vast majority of Mexicans who have at least partial Arab descent trace their ancestry to what is now Lebanon and Syria br Arab immigration to Mexico started in the th and early th centuries Roughly Arabs settled in Mexico during this time period They came mostly from Lebanon Syria Palestine and Iraq and settled in significant numbers in Nayarit Puebla Mexico City and the Northern part of the country mainly in the states of Baja California Tamaulipas Nuevo Leon Sinaloa Chihuahua Coahuila and Durango as well as the city of Tampico and Guadalajara br During the Israel Lebanon war in and during the Six Day War thousands of Lebanese left Lebanon and went to Mexico They first arrived in Veracruz Although Arabs made up less than of the total immigrant population in Mexico during the s they constituted half of the immigrant economic activity br Immigration of Arabs in Mexico has influenced Mexican culture in particular food where they have introduced kibbeh tabbouleh and even created recipes such as tacos rabes By dates which originated from the Middle East were introduced into Mexico by the Spaniards The fusion between Arab and Mexican food has highly influenced the Yucatecan cuisine br The majority of Arab Mexicans are Christians who belong to the Maronite Roman Catholic Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches A scant number are Muslims as well as indigenous Muslims which are most common in southern states like Chiapas or Oaxaca And Jews of Middle Eastern origins br br br Romani Mexicans br br The first wave of Roma arrived in Mexico in the s when they came to the Americas from Hungary Poland and Russia and mainly settled in the United States and Brazil but also in Mexico Argentina Chile Colombia Ecuador Uruguay and Venezuela There are Romani communities in the cities of Mexico City Veracruz Puebla Guadalajara and Monterrey There is also a large Romani community in San Lu s Potos br br br Asian Mexicans br br Asian immigration began with the forced arrival of people from the jurisdictions of the Spanish East Indies during Mexico s viceregal period For two and a half centuries between and the Philippines Guam and Marianas islands etc were ruled from Mexico City for the Spanish crown During this period the Manila Acapulco Galleon assisting Spain in its trade between Asia and the Americas was formed Thousands of Filipinos were brought on these voyages to Mexico as slaves and were called Chino which meant Chinese Some were also ship crew members and prisoners In with the groups of Filipinos there were in reality many diverse Asians including Malays Javanese Cambodians Timorese and people from Makassar Tidore Terenate and China All of these were referred to as chino A notable example is the story of Catarina de San Juan Mirra an Indian girl captured by the Portuguese and sold into slavery in Manila She arrived in New Spain and eventually she gave rise to the China Poblana br The reverse was also true thousands of Mexicans of varying races also ended up as immigrants to the Philippines back when there was a Philippine population of only Million Filipinos br Later groups of Asians predominantly Chinese became Mexico s fastest growing immigrant group from the s to the s exploding from about in to more than in but also met with strong anti Chinese sentiment especially in Sonora and Sinaloa which led to deportations and illegal expulsions of many of them and their descendants br br br Official censuses br Historically population studies and censuses have never been up to the standards that a population as diverse and numerous such as Mexico s require The first racial census was made in being also Mexico s then known as New Spain first ever nationwide population census Of it only part of the original datasets survive Thus most of what is known of it comes from essays made by researchers who used the census findings as reference for their own works More than a century would pass until the Mexican government conducted a new racial census in some sources assert that the census of included a comprehensive racial classification however according to the historic archives of Mexico s National Institute of Statistics that was not the case While the census was the last time the Mexican government conducted a census that included a comprehensive racial classification in recent time it has conducted nationwide surveys to quantify most of the ethnic groups who inhabit the country as well as the social dynamics and inequalities between them br br br census br br Also known as the Revillagigedo census due to its creation being ordered by the Count of the same name this census was Mexico s then known as the Viceroyalty of New Spain first ever nationwide population census Most of its original datasets have reportedly been lost thus most of what is now known about it comes from essays and field investigations made by academics who had access to the census data and used it as reference for their works such as Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt Each author gives different estimations for each racial group in the country although they do not vary much with Europeans ranging from to of New Spain s population Mestizos ranging from to Amerindians ranging from to and Africans being between and The estimations given for the total population range from to It is concluded then that across nearly three centuries of colonization the population growth trends of Europeans and Mestizos were even while the total percentage of the Indigenous population decreased at a rate of per century The authors assert that rather than Europeans and mestizos having higher birthrates the reason for the Indigenous population s numbers decreasing lies on them suffering of higher mortality rates due living in remote locations rather than on cities and towns founded by the Spanish colonists or being at war with them It is also for these reasons that the number of Indigenous Mexicans presents the greater variation range between publications as in cases their numbers in a given location were estimated rather than counted leading to possible overestimations in some provinces and possible underestimations in others br br Europeans are included within the Mestizo category br Regardless of the possible imprecisions related to the counting of Indigenous peoples living outside the colonized areas the effort that New Spain s authorities put on considering them as subjects is worth mentioning as censuses made by other colonial or post colonial countries did not consider Amerindians to be citizens subjects as example the censuses made by the Viceroyalty of the R o de la Plata would only count the inhabitants of the colonized settlements Other example would be the censuses made by the United States that did not include Indigenous peoples living among the general population until and indigenous peoples as a whole until br br br census br br Made right after the consummation of the Mexican revolution the social context on which this census was made makes it particularly unique as the government of the time was in the process of rebuilding the country and was looking forward to unite all Mexicans under a single national identity The census final results in regards to race which assert that of the Mexican population self identified as Mestizo as Indigenous and only as White were then essential to cement the mestizaje ideology that asserts that the Mexican population as a whole is product of the admixture of all races which shaped Mexican identity and culture through the th century and remain prominent nowadays with extraofficial international publications such as The World Factbook and Encyclop dia Britannica using them as a reference to estimate Mexico s racial composition up to this day br Nonetheless in recent times the census results have been subjected to scrutiny by historians academics and social activists alike who assert that such drastic alterations on demographic trends with respect to the census are not possible and cite among other statistics the relatively low frequency of marriages between people of different continental ancestries in colonial and early independent Mexico It is claimed that the mestizaje process sponsored by the state was more cultural than biological which resulted on the numbers of the Mestizo Mexican group being inflated at the expense of the identity of other races Controversies aside this census constituted the last time the Mexican Government conducted a comprehensive racial census with the breakdown by states being the following foreigners and people who answered other not included br br When the census results are compared with the results of Mexico s recent censuses as well as with modern genetic research high consistence is found in regards to the distribution of Indigenous Mexicans across the country with states located in south and south eastern Mexico having both the highest percentages of population that self identifies as Indigenous and the highest percentages of Amerindian genetic ancestry However this is not the case when it comes to European Mexicans as there are instances on which states that have been shown to have a considerably high European ancestry per scientific research are reported to have very small white populations in the census with the most extreme case being that of the state of Durango where the aforementioned census asserts that only of the state s population persons self identified as white while modern scientific research shows that the population of Durango has similar genetic frequencies to those found on European peoples with the state s Indigenous population showing almost no foreign admixture either Various authors theorize that the reason for these inconsistencies may lie in the Mestizo identity promoted by the Mexican government which reportedly led to people who are not biologically Mestizos to identify as such br br br Present day br br Since the end of the Mexican Revolution the official identity promoted by the government for non indigenous Mexicans has been the Mestizo one a mix of European and indigenous culture and heritage Established with the original intent of eliminating divisions and creating a unified identity that would allow Mexico to modernize and integrate with the international community this policy has not been able to achieve its goal It is speculated that this is due to the identity s own internal contradictions as it includes in the same theoretical race people who in daily interactions do not consider each other to be of the same race and have little in common biologically with some of them being entirely Indigenous others entirely European and including also Africans and Asians Today there is no definitive census that quantifies Mexico s white population with estimates from the Mexican government raging from to with this figure being based on phenotypical traits instead of self identification of ancestry The lack of a clear dividing line between white and mixed race Mexicans has made the concept of race relatively fluid with descent being more of a determining factor than biological traits br Generally speaking ethnic relations can be arranged on an axis between the two extremes of European and Amerindian cultural heritage this is a remnant of the Spanish caste system which categorized individuals according to their perceived level of biological mixture between the two groups Additionally the presence of considerable portions of the population with African heritage further complicates the situation In practice the classificatory system is no longer biologically based but rather mixes socio cultural traits with phenotypical traits and classification is largely fluid allowing individuals to move between categories and define their ethnic and racial identities situationally Even though there is a large variation in phenotypes among Mexicans European looks are still strongly preferred in Mexican society with lighter skin receiving more positive attention as it is associated with higher social class power money and modernity In contrast Indigenous ancestry is often associated with having an inferior social class as well as lower levels of education These distinctions are strongest in Mexico City where the most powerful of the country s elite are located br br Despite Mexico s government not using racial terms related to European or white people officially for almost a century resuming using such terms after the concepts of white people known as g eros or blancos in Mexican Spanish and of being white didn t disappear and are still present in everyday Mexican culture different idioms of race are used in Mexico s society that serve as mediating terms between racial groups It is not strange to see street vendors calling a potential costumer G ero or g erito sometimes even when the person is not light skinned In this instance it is used to initiate a kind of familiarity but in cases where social racial tensions are relatively high it can have the opposite effect However contemporary sociologists and historians agree that given that the concept of race has a psychological foundation rather than a biological one and to society s eyes a Mestizo with a high percentage of European ancestry is considered white and a Mestizo with a high percentage of Indigenous ancestry is considered Indian a person who identifies with a given ethnic group should be allowed to even if biologically doesn t completely belong to that group br br br Genetic studies br br Genetic studies in Mexico can be divided on three groups studies made on self identified Mestizos studies made on Indigenous peoples and studies made on the general Mexican population Studies that focus on Mexicans of predominantly European descent or Afro Mexicans have not been made Mexicans who self identify as Mestizos are primarily of European and Native American ancestry The third largest component is African in coastal areas this is partly a legacy of the slavery in New Spain black slaves However the authors of this study state that the majority of African ancestry in Mexicans is of North and Sub Saharan African origin and was brought by the Spaniards themselves as a diluted part of their genetic ancestry br According to the average of various studies Mexicans are on average European Amerindian African and Asian However this varies greatly by methodology and study some point toward a greater Amerindian admixture whereas others point toward a greater European admixture Admixture varies by region wealth and even study However it can be generally assessed that Mexicans on average are an even mixture of Native American and European with minor African contribution with neither European or Native being more dominant in the genetic admixture According to these studies Native admixture is more dominant in the Central and Southern regions of Mexico whereas European admixture is more dominant in the Western and Northern regions of Mexico Mestizos and Amerindians tend to have slightly more dominant Amerindian admixture whereas Mexicans considered White tend to have dominant European admixture br Those DNA studies on Mexicans show a significant genetic variation depending on the region analyzed with the central region of Mexico showing a balance between indigenous and European components and the latter gradually increasing as one travels northwards and westwards where European ancestry becomes the majority of the genetic contribution up until cities located at the Mexico United States border where studies suggest there is a significant resurgence of indigenous and African admixture In southern Mexico there is prevalent indigenous Meso American but also European admixture and a small but higher than average African genetic contributions br br According to numerous studies on average the largest genetic component of Mexicans who self identify as being Mestizos is indigenous although the difference in incidence between the indigenous and European composites is relatively small both representing well over of the genetic composition of Mestizos br In two studies of Mexicans from Mexico City and the United States researchers noted that Mexicans had mostly European ancestry with Native American ancestry making up of the general ancestry of Mexicans However Native American X chromosomal ancestry exceeded and other studies found that approximately of Mexicans carried a Native American maternal haplogroup The authors suggest that this is consistent with the ethnogenesis of Latinos through intermarriages that mostly involved European men and Native American women br Extant research suggests that geographic location plays a more significant role on determining the genetic makeup of the average Indigenous person than cultural traits do an example of this is the indigenous population of Tlapa in the state of Guerrero that despite for the most part speaking Spanish and having the same cultural customs non indigenous Mexicans have shows an indigenous ancestry of In contrast one study shows Nahua speaking Indigenous peoples from Coyolillo Veracruz having a mean European ancestry of and an African ancestry of br br The Mestizaje ideology which has blurred the lines of race at an institutional level has also had a significant influence in genetic studies done in Mexico As the criterion used in studies to determine if a Mexican is Mestizo or indigenous often lies in cultural traits such as the language spoken instead of racial self identification or a phenotype based selection there are studies on which populations who are considered to be Indigenous per virtue of the language spoken show a higher degree of European genetic admixture than the one populations considered to be Mestizo report in other studies The opposite also happens as there instances on which populations considered to be Mestizo show genetic frequencies very similar to continental European peoples in the case of Mestizos from the state of Durango or to European derived Americans in the case of Mestizos from the state of Jalisco br In an autosomal study was performed in Mexicans from the states of Nuevo Leon Zacatecas and San Luis Potos with a sample pool of It found the average admixture to be Spanish and Mexican Indian Indigenous The data also shows younger generations having higher Native American admixture compared to older ones In the report the oldest generation had an averaged total of Spanish ancestry br br A study conducted by Mexico s National Institute of Genomic Medicine INMEGEN which genotyped samples reported that mestizo Mexicans are European Asian Native American and Black Of the six states that participated in the Study the state of Sonora showed the highest European ancestry being approximately while the State of Guerrero presented the lowest European ancestry at around However is the same team published an updated finding which sampled Mexicans who self identified as Mestizos the average admixture was calculated to be percent Native American European African and Asian br In researchers looked through approximately twenty previous studies done on the admixture of Mexicans Their general conclusion was the average Mexican is more Native American than European br Subsequently in a separate team of researchers performed a meta analysis incorporating the findings of many previous studies with additional research This comprehensive analysis revealed a genetic composition with an average of Native American European and African br A study reported highly variable ancestry in Mexican Mestizos ranging from Amerindian European African Mart nez Cort s et al br In a genetic study gave results of Amerindian European and African for Mexican Mestizos The authors reported similar findings of geographical variation as in other studies Native American ancestry is lower in northerly regions of Mexico and higher in the south African ancestry is generally quite low across most of Mexico with the exception of a small number of coastal communities br An autosomal study performed in Mestizos from Mexico s three largest cities reported that Mestizos from Mexico city had an average ancestry of European African and Amerindian whereas Mestizos from the cities of Monterrey and Guadalajara had both a European ancestry of and an indigenous ancestry of in average br br An autosomal study performed in Mexico City reported that Mexican mestizos mean ancestry was European Amerindian and African However the sample pool was extremely low at only Researchers Francisco Mauro Salzano and M nica Sans referred to it as an anomalous value in their report mentioned earlier br Additional studies suggests a tendency relating a higher European admixture with a higher socioeconomic status and a higher Amerindian ancestry with a lower socioeconomic status a study made exclusively on low income Mestizos residing in Mexico City found the mean admixture to be and for Amerindian European and African respectively whereas the European admixture increased to an average of around on mestizos belonging to a higher socioeconomical level br An autosomal genetic study which included the states of Mexico Morelos Puebla Queretaro and Mexico City determined the average ancestry of the central region of Mexico to be European Amerindian and African br An autosomal genetic study performed in the town of Metztitlan in the state of Hidalgo reported that the average genetic ancestry of the town s autochthonous indigenous population was Amerindian European and African br A study published by the Journal of Human Genetics of Y chromosomes found the deep paternal ancestry of the Mexican mestizo population to be predominately European followed by Amerindian and Asian The European Y chromosome was more prevalent in the north and west and Native American ancestry increased in the center and southeast the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous The states that participated in this study where Aguascalientes Chiapas Chihuahua Durango Guerrero Jalisco Oaxaca Sinaloa Veracruz and Yucat n The largest amount of chromosomes found were identified as belonging to the haplogroups from Western Europe East Europe and Eurasia Siberia and the Americas and Northern Europe with relatively smaller traces of haplogroups from Central Asia South east Asia South central Asia Western Asia The Caucasus North Africa Near East East Asia North east Asia South west Asia and the Middle East br Depending on the region some may have small traces of Asian admixture due to the thousands of Filipinos and Chinos Asian slaves of diverse origins not just Chinese that arrived on the Nao de China More recent Asian immigration specifically Chinese may help explain the comparatively high Asian contribution in Northwest Mexico i e Sonora br br br Etiological studies br Etiological studies are genetic studies on which volunteers suffer of a specific health condition disease as diseases tend to manifest on higher frequencies on people with a determinated genetic ancestry the results of said studies are not accurate to represent the genetics of the population said volunteers belong to as a whole br br Amerindian European African for northeast de M xico Mart nez Fierro et al br Amerindian European African for Ciudad de M xico Kosoy et al br Amerindian European African for Ciudad de M xico br br br Phenotypical research br br br Albeit not as numerous or with a history as long as genetic research in the country studies regarding the presence of different phenotypical traits hair color hair shape eye color etc in Mexicans have been made Those studies have recently gained the attention of Mexico s government which has begun conducting its own nationwide investigations with the aim of document dynamics and inequalities on interactions between Mexicans of different ethnicities races as well as to have a more concise idea of the ethnic composition of the country a field that has been long neglected at an institutional level in Mexico The results of these studies effectively refute misconceptions regarding Mexico s population showing that Mexico is an exceptionally diverse country where any color or type of trait can be found with ease in any region br Some studies such as the one published by the American Sociological Association refute misconceptions that are very prevalent even among Mexicans themselves as it found the differences in the frequencies of phenotypical traits such as blond hair between the population of the Northern regions of Mexico where this trait has a frequency of and the population of the Central regions of Mexico with a frequency of are not as pronounced as are commonly thought to be Per the methodology of the study the presence of blond hair was required for a Mexican to be classified as white as unlike skin color blond hair does not darken with sun exposure With a similar methodology other study made by the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the frequency of blond hair at Mexicans with red hair were classified as other br A study made by the University College London analyzed the frequencies of several different phenotypical traits on populations of five different Latin American countries Brazil Chile Colombia Mexico and Peru In the case of Mexico the National Institute of Anthropology and History collaborated in the investigation with the results being the following br br The majority of the samples approx hailed from Mexico City and Southern Mexican states meaning that Northern and Western regions of Mexico were under represented as around of Mexico s population lives there br br Nationwide surveys sponsored by the Mexican government that quantify the percentage of the different skin tones present on Mexico s population have been made the first in by the CONAPRED Mexico s National Bureau for Prevention of Discrimination and the second in by the INEGI Mexico s National Institute of Statistics Each study used a different color palette in the case of CONAPRED s study it was a palette with color choices developed by the institute itself whereas in the case of the INEGI study the palette used was the palette for the PERLA Latin American Race and Ethnicity Project with color categories br br As the progression from the darker tones to the lightest ones is not as uniform in the palette used by the INEGI some tones are practically the same while there are marked differences between others as it is in the CONAPRED s palette two color categories ended up containing nearly of surveyed Mexicans whereas there were color categories that had less than of Mexicans each Even though Mexico s government has downplayed the racial connotations of said studies by opting for using the term light skinned Mexican to refer to the segment of Mexico s population who possess European physical traits appearance and dark skinned Mexican to refer the segment of Mexico s population who does not the publication of said studies has not been free of controversy specially in the case of the study published in as besides skin color it also accounted for different socioeconomic factors such as educational achievements and occupational profiles with media outlets bringing to Mexico s mainstream opinion circles concepts such as systemic racism white privilege and colonialism Nonetheless it is agreed that to acknowledge that Mexico is a diverse country constitutes a step in the right direction to fight social inequalities br In the new edition of the ENADIS was published this time being a joint effort by the CONAPRED and the INEGI with collaboration of the UNAM the CONACyT and the CNDH Like its antecessor it surveyed Mexican citizens about topics related to discrimination and collected data related to phenotype and ethnic self identification It concluded that Mexico is still a fairly conservative country regarding minority groups such as religious minorities ethnic minorities foreigners members of the LGBT collective etc albeit there are pronounced regional differences with states in the south center regions of Mexico having in general notoriously higher discrimination rates towards the aforementioned social groups than the ones states in the western north regions have For the collecting of data related to skin color the palette used was again the PERLA one This time of Mexicans were reported to have dark skin tones A E to have medium skin tones F G and to have light skin tones H K The reason for the huge difference regarding the reported percentages of Mexicans with light skin around lower and medium skin around higher in the relation to previous nationwide surveys lies in the fact that the ENADIS prioritized the surveying of Mexicans from vulnerable groups which among other measures meant that states with known high numbers of people from said groups surveyed more people br The following tables the first from a study published in and the second from a study published in show the frequencies of different blood types in various Mexican cities and states as Mexico s Amerindian Indigenous population exclusively exhibits the O blood type the presence of other blood groups can give an approximate idea of the amount of foreign influence there is in each state that has been analyzed The results of this studies however should not be taken as exact literal estimations for the percentages of different ethnic groups that there may be in Mexico i e A B blood groups percentage of White Mexicans for reasons such as the fact that a Mestizo Mexican can have A B etc blood types or the fact that the O blood type does exist in Europe with it having a frequency of in Spain for example br br Both studies find similar trends regarding the distribution of different blood groups with foreign blood groups being more common in the North and Western regions of Mexico which is congruent with the findings of genetic studies that have been made in the country through the years It is also observed that A and B blood groups are more common among younger volunteers whereas AB and O are more common in older ones The total number of analyzed samples in the study was br A study performed in hospitals of Mexico City reported that on average of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the Mongolian spot whilst it was absent in of the analyzed babies The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency in Asian Native American and African children The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos while having a very low frequency in
