Puerto Ricans Spanish Puertorrique os most commonly known as Boricuas but also occasionally referred to as Borinque os Borincanos or Puertorros are an ethnic group native to the Caribbean archipelago and island of Puerto Rico and a nation identified with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico through ancestry culture or history Puerto Ricans are predominately a tri racial Spanish speaking Christian society descending in varying degrees from Indigenous Ta no natives Southwestern European colonists and West and Central African slaves freedmen and free Blacks As citizens of a U S territory Puerto Ricans have automatic birthright American citizenship and are considerably influenced by American culture The population of Puerto Ricans is between and million worldwide with the overwhelming majority residing in Puerto Rico and mainland United States br br br Overview br br The culture held in common by most Puerto Ricans is referred to as a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of Spain and more specifically Andalusia and the Canary Islands Puerto Rico has also received immigration from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia as well as from other European countries such as France Ireland Italy and Germany Puerto Rico has also been influenced by African culture with many Puerto Ricans partially descended from Africans though Afro Puerto Ricans of unmixed African descent are only a significant minority Also present in today s Puerto Ricans are traces about of the aboriginal Taino natives that inhabited the island at the time European colonizers arrived in Recent studies in population genetics have concluded that Puerto Rican gene pool is on average predominantly European with a significant Sub Saharan African North African Guanche and Indigenous American substrate the latter two originating in the aboriginal people of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico s pre Columbian Ta no inhabitants respectively br The population of Puerto Ricans and descendants is estimated to be between and million worldwide with most living on the islands of Puerto Rico and in the United States mainland Within the United States Puerto Ricans are present in all states of the Union and the states with the largest populations of Puerto Ricans relative to the national population of Puerto Ricans in the United States at large are the states of New York Florida New Jersey and Pennsylvania with large populations also in Massachusetts Connecticut California Illinois and Texas br For the American Community Survey estimates give a total of Puerto Ricans classified as Native Puerto Ricans It also gives a total of of the population being born in Puerto Rico and born in the United States The total population born outside Puerto Rico is Of the who were foreign born outside the United States of Puerto Ricans were born in Latin America in Europe in Asia in Northern America and in Africa and Oceania each br br br Number of Puerto Ricans br br br Population br The populations during Spanish rule of Puerto Rico were br br br Current population and its self identified racial makeup br br br Ancestry and Genetics br br The original inhabitants of Puerto Rico are the Ta no who called the island Borik n or Borinquen however as in other parts of the Americas the native people soon diminished in number after the arrival of Spanish settlers Besides miscegenation the negative impact on the numbers of Amerindian people especially in Puerto Rico was almost entirely the result of Old World diseases that the Amerindians had no natural bodily defenses against including measles chicken pox mumps influenza and even the common cold In fact it was estimated that the majority of all the Amerindian inhabitants of the New World died out due to contact and contamination with those Old World diseases while those that survived were further reduced through deaths by warfare with Spanish colonizers and settlers br Thousands of Spanish settlers also immigrated to Puerto Rico from the Canary Islands during the th and th centuries so many so that whole Puerto Rican villages and towns were founded by Canarian immigrants and their descendants would later form a majority of the population on the island br In the slaves in Saint Domingue Haiti revolted against their French masters Many of the French escaped to Puerto Rico via what is now the Dominican Republic and settled in the west coast of the island especially in Mayag ez Some Puerto Ricans are of British heritage most notably Scottish people and English people who came to reside there in the th and th centuries br When Spain revived the Royal Decree of Graces of with the intention of attracting non Spanish Europeans to settle in the island thousands of Corsicans though the island was French since the population spoke an Italian dialect similar to Tuscan Italian during the th century immigrated to Puerto Rico along with German immigrants as well as Irish immigrants who were affected by the Great Famine of the s immigrated to Puerto Rico They were followed by smaller waves from other European countries and China br During the early th century Jews began to settle in Puerto Rico The first large group of Jews to settle in Puerto Rico were European refugees fleeing German occupied Europe in the s and s The second influx of Jews to the island came in the s when thousands of Cuban Jews fled Cuba after Fidel Castro came to power br br br Ethnogenesis br The native Taino population began to dwindle with the arrival of the Spanish in the th century through disease and intermarriage Many Spaniard men took Taino and West African wives and in the first centuries of the Spanish colonial period the island was overwhelmingly racially mixed By there were native women married to Spaniards not to mention Spaniards with concubines Under Spanish rule mass immigration shifted the ethnic make up of the island as a result of the Royal Decree of Graces of Puerto Rico went from being two thirds black and mulatto in the beginning of the th century to being nearly white by the middle of the th century This was compounded by more flexible attitudes to race under Spanish rule as epitomized by the Regla del Sacar Under Spanish rule Puerto Rico had laws such as Regla del Sacar or Gracias al Sacar which allowed persons of mixed ancestry to pay a fee to be classified as white which was the opposite of one drop rule in US society after the American Civil War br br Studies have shown that the racial ancestry mixture of the average Puerto Rican regardless of racial self identity is about European African and Native Taino with European ancestry strongest on the west side of the island and West African ancestry strongest on the east side and the levels of Taino ancestry which according to some research ranges from about generally highest in the southwest of the island br A study of a sample of healthy self identified White Puerto Ricans and self identified Black Puerto Ricans in the U S showed that although all carried a contribution from all ancestral populations European African and Amerindian the proportions showed significant variation Depending on individuals although often correlating with their self identified race African ancestry ranged from less than to over while European ancestry ranged from under to over Amerindian ancestry showed less fluctuation generally hovering between and irrespective of self identified race br The majority of the European ancestry in Puerto Ricans comes from southern Spain more specifically the Canary Islands this is also true for many Dominicans and Cubans Canarians are of partial Guanche ancestry a North African Berber ethnic group who were the original inhabitants before Spanish conquest This means that by extension many Puerto Ricans have miniscule amounts of North African blood through the indigenous Guanches of the Canary Islands br br br Self identified race br br br White br br In the census taken the year Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States following its invasion and annexation in the Spanish American War of the people were identified as White In the United States Census the total of Puerto Ricans that self identified as White was or out of the people living in Puerto Rico down from in the Census reflecting a change in perceptions of race in Puerto Rico For every United States census until most Puerto Ricans self identified as white br The European ancestry of Puerto Ricans comes primarily from one source Spaniards including Canarians Catalans Castilians Galicians Asturians Andalusians and Basques br The Canarian cultural influence in Puerto Rico is one of the most important components in which many villages were founded from these immigrants which started from to and beyond Many Spaniards especially Canarians chose Puerto Rico because of its Hispanic ties and relative proximity in comparison with other former Spanish colonies They searched for security and stability in an environment similar to that of the Canary Islands and Puerto Rico was the most suitable This began as a temporary exile which became a permanent relocation and the last significant wave of Spanish or European migration to Puerto Rico br Other sources of European populations are Corsicans French Italians Portuguese especially Azoreans Greeks Germans Irish Scots Maltese Dutch English and Danes br br br Black br br In the United States Census of people self identified as Black Africans were brought by Spanish Conquistadors The vast majority of the Africans who were brought to Puerto Rico did so as a result of the slave trade taking place from many groups in the African continent but particularly the West Africans the Yoruba the Igbo and the Kongo people br br br Indigenous br br Indigenous people make up the third largest racial identity among Puerto Ricans comprising of the population Although this self identification may be ethno political in nature since unmixed Tainos no longer exist as a discrete genetic population Native American admixture in Puerto Ricans ranges between about and with around being the approximate average br Puerto Rico s self identified indigenous population therefore consist mostly of indigenous identified persons oftentimes with predominant Indigenous ancestry but not always from within the genetically mestizo population of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry even when most other Puerto Ricans of their exact same mixture would identify either as mixed race or even as white br br br Asian br br For its census the U S Census Bureau listed the following groups to constitute Asian Asian Indian Bangladeshi Bhutanese Cambodian Chinese Filipino Hmong Indonesian Japanese Korean Laotian Malaysian Nepalese Pakistani Sri Lankan Taiwanese Thai Vietnamese and Other Asian Though the largest groups come from China and India These groups represented of the population br br br Other br br People of Some other race alone or Two or more races constituted of the population in the Census br Although the average Puerto Rican is of mixed race few actually identified as multiracial two or more races in the census only did so They more often identified with their predominant heritage or phenotype However in the census the amount of Puerto Ricans identifying as multiracial went up to and an additional identified as some other race showing a marked change in the way Puerto Ricans view themselves This may show that Puerto Ricans are now more open to embracing all sides of their mixed race heritage and do not view themselves as part of the standard race dynamic in the United States hence the high number of people identifying as some other race a similar phenomenon went on in the mainland United States with the overall US Hispanic Latino population br Most have significant ancestry from two or more of the founding source populations of Spaniards Africans and Tainos although Spanish ancestry is predominant in a majority of the population Small amounts of Puerto Ricans may have additional ancestries from other parts of the world Similar to many other Latin American ethnic groups Puerto Ricans are multi generationally mixed race though most are European dominant in ancestry Puerto Ricans who are evenly mixed can accurately be described Mulatto Quadroon or Tri racial very similar to mixed populations in Cuba and Dominican Republic According to the National Geographic Genographic Project the average Puerto Rican individual carries Native American West Eurasian Mediterranean Northern European and or Middle Eastern and Sub Saharan African DNA br In genetic terms even many of those of pure Spanish origin would have North and in some cases West African ancestry brought from founder populations particularly in the Canary Islands Along with European West African and Taino many Puerto Ricans have small amounts of North African blood due to settlers from Canary Islands the Spanish province where most Puerto Ricans draw their European ancestry from being of partial North African blood Very few self identified Black Puerto Ricans are of unmixed African ancestry while a genetically unmixed Amerindian population in Puerto Rico is technically extinct despite a minuscule segment of self identified Amerindian Puerto Ricans due to a minor Amerindian component in their ancestral mixture Research data shows that of Puerto Ricans carry maternal lineages of Native American origin and the typical Puerto Rican has between and Native American admixture br br br Modern identity br br The Puerto Rico of today has come to form some of its own social customs cultural matrix historically rooted traditions and its own unique pronunciation vocabulary and idiomatic expressions within the Spanish language known as Puerto Rican Spanish Even after the attempted assimilation of Puerto Rico into the United States in the early th century the majority of the people of Puerto Rico feel pride in their Puerto Rican nationality regardless of the individual s particular racial ethnic political or economic background Many Puerto Ricans are consciously aware of the rich contribution of all cultures represented on the island This diversity can be seen in the everyday lifestyle of many Puerto Ricans such as the profound Latin African and Ta no influences regarding food music dance and architecture br br br Emigration br br During the Spanish colonial period there was significant migration from Puerto Rico to Santo Domingo DR Cuba the Virgin Islands and Venezuela and vice versa because migration between neighboring colonies especially under the same European power was common Nearly all Puerto Ricans who migrated to these areas during these times assimilated and intermixed with the local populations In the early days of US rule from to the s the Puerto Rican economy was small and undeveloped it relied heavily on agriculture At this time Puerto Rican migration waves were mainly to Dominican Republic the Virgin Islands and US cities such as Boston Philadelphia Baltimore Miami New Orleans and most importantly metropolitan area surrounding New York City and North Jersey Over Puerto Ricans migrated to Hawaii from to Puerto Rican migration to the US northeast started as early as the s however it was a very very small flow at the time During the s Puerto Rican desire for independence slowly started to decline while desire for statehood and dependence on the US started rise due to this more Puerto Ricans started to look at the US more favorably and take full advantage of their US citizenship huge flows of Puerto Ricans started to arrive in the United States particularly industrial cities in the Northeast and Midwest coinciding with a strong decline in Puerto Ricans migrating to other countries and even other areas in the US like Baltimore New Orleans and Hawaii From to the stateside Puerto Rican population rose from to br In the modern day there are about million Puerto Ricans in the US mainland Large concentrations can be found in the Northeast region and in Florida in the metropolitan areas of New York Orlando Philadelphia Miami Chicago Tampa and Boston among others Though over of Puerto Ricans living outside of Puerto Rico live in the United States US states there is a significant and growing number of Puerto Ricans mainly from Puerto Rico itself but to a lesser degree stateside Puerto Ricans as well living outside the States and the US territory of Puerto Rico Puerto Rican populations in other countries are very small not large enough to have dominance over certain neighborhoods and cities like in Florida and the US Northeast Unsurprisingly Puerto Rico s neighbors have the biggest Puerto Rican communities outside Puerto Rico and the US mainland to the west Dominican Republic with as high as Puerto Ricans according to some sources and to the east US Virgin Islands with of the territory s population second highest percentage of any US state or territory after Puerto Rico and before Connecticut There are small numbers of Puerto Ricans in other countries like Canada Spain Mexico United Kingdom and other countries in Europe and the Caribbean Latin America Due to Puerto Rico being a US territory the vast majority of Puerto Ricans leaving the island go to the mainland United States comprising Puerto Ricans of all income brackets and lifestyles However majority of the small number of Puerto Ricans living outside of the United States including outside of Puerto Rico and other territories are usually financially well off and entrepreneurial owning homes and businesses in the countries they choose to settle in Statistical counts of Puerto Rican populations in other countries usually only center on ethnic Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico Non Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico and later moving to target country usually wouldn t be included in a Puerto Rican population count especially if they have ancestry of at least one parent born in target country for example people of Dominican Cuban or Mexican etc ancestry born in Puerto Rico and later returning to their ancestral country wouldn t be counted in a Puerto Rican population count but likely rather counted as a returning emigrant Similarly Puerto Ricans born in the mainland United States would be counted under an American statistic so the Puerto Rican populations abroad may be slightly larger as some may be stateside born and counted as American rather than Puerto Rican on local government statistics on immigrants br br br Language br Spanish and English are the official languages of the entire Commonwealth A English only language law was abolished on April Then on January the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico approved Law Number again making Spanish and English the official languages of Puerto Rico All official business of the U S District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English The official languages of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English with Spanish being the primary language English is the primary language of less than of the population br Puerto Rican Spanish is the dominant language of business education and daily life on the island The US Census Bureau s update provides the following of adults speak Spanish speak only English and little to no Spanish do not speak English very well are fully bilingual in both English and Spanish speak other languages br Public school instruction in Puerto Rico is conducted almost entirely in Spanish There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only Objections from teaching staff are common perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school br Home to a sizeable deaf community the actual numbers are unknown due to unavailable source data A estimate places the Puerto Rican deaf population to be between and Due to ongoing colonization from the US mainland the larger American Sign Language ASL is supplanting the local Puerto Rican Sign Language PRSL also known as LSPR Lenguaje de Se as Puertorrique o Although assumed to be a dialect or variant of ASL it is currently unknown the degree of mutual intelligibility between Puerto Rican Sign Language nor whether it is even a Francosign language like ASL Indeed there is a hesitancy amongst Puerto Rican Deaf to even mention LSPR after heavy handed oralist education of English Spanish and Signed English Today there is much contact between ASL PRSL and Signed Spanish br The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere While the Spanish spoken in all Iberian Mediterranean and Atlantic Spanish Maritime Provinces was brought to the island over the centuries the most profound regional influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has been from that spoken in the present day Canary Islands The Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes occasional Ta no words typically in the context of vegetation natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments Similarly words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods music or dances br br br Religion br There are many religious beliefs represented in the island Religious breakdown in Puerto Rico as of is given in the table on the right br br The majority of Puerto Ricans in the island are Christians Spiritists have a large secondary following Muslims Hindus Jews and Buddhists all have a small presence as well Roman Catholicism has been the main Christian denomination among Puerto Ricans since the arrival of the Spanish in the th century but the presence of Protestant Mormon Pentecostal and Jehovah s Witnesses denominations has increased under U S sovereignty making modern Puerto Rico an inter denominational multi religious community The Afro Caribbean religion Santer a is also practiced br In a news report stated that Puerto Rico was no longer predominantly Catholic Pollster Pablo Ramos wrote that the population was Roman Catholic Pentecostal and were members of independent churches However an Associated Press article in March stated that more than percent of Puerto Ricans identify themselves as Catholic The CIA World Factbook reports that of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic while identify as Protestant and Other br br br Political and international status br br Puerto Ricans became citizens of the United States as a result of the passage of the Jones Shafroth Act of Since this law was the result of Congressional legislation and not the result of an amendment to the United States Constitution the current U S citizenship of Puerto Ricans can be revoked by Congress as they are statutory citizens not th Amendment citizens The Jones Act established that Puerto Ricans born prior to were considered naturalized citizens of Puerto Rico and anyone born after were U S citizens unless the Puerto Rican expressed his her intentions to remain a Spanish subject Since it was decided by Congress that all Puerto Ricans whether born within the United States or in Puerto Rico were naturally born United States citizens br Puerto Ricans and other U S citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote in presidential elections as that is a right reserved by the U S Constitution to admitted states and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College system Nevertheless both the Democratic Party and Republican Party while not fielding candidates for public office in Puerto Rico provide the islands with state sized voting delegations at their presidential nominating conventions Delegate selection processes frequently have resulted in presidential primaries being held in Puerto Rico U S citizens residing in Puerto Rico do not elect U S representatives or senators However Puerto Rico is represented in the House of Representatives by an elected representative commonly known as the Resident Commissioner who has the same duties and obligations as a representative with the exception of being able to cast votes on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor The Resident Commissioner is elected by Puerto Ricans to a four year term and does serve on congressional committee Puerto Ricans residing in the U S states have all rights and privileges of other U S citizens living in the states br As statutory U S citizens Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico may enlist in the U S military and have been included in the compulsory draft when it has been in effect Puerto Ricans have fully participated in all U S wars and military conflicts since including World War I World War II the Korean War the Vietnam War the Gulf War the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War br Since the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans In order to be eligible applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican born parent or be an American citizen with at least one year residence in Puerto Rico The citizenship is internationally recognized by Spain which considers Puerto Rico to be an Ibero American nation Therefore Puerto Rican citizens have the ability to apply for Spanish citizenship after only two years residency in Spain instead of the standard years br br br Decolonization and status referendums br Since the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving independence or decolonization In the Special Committee determined that a colonial relationship existed between the US and Puerto Rico br The UN s Special Committee has referred often to Puerto Rico as a nation in its reports because internationally the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity Most recently in a June report the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self determination in Puerto Rico More specifically the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self determination and independence allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs including unemployment marginalization insolvency and poverty br Puerto Rico has held four referendums to determine whether to retain its status as a territory or to switch to some other status such as statehood The fourth the Puerto Rican status referendum occurred on November The result a majority of the ballots cast against the continuation of the island s territorial political status and in favor of a new status Of votes for new status a majority chose statehood This was by far the most successful referendum for statehood advocates In all earlier referendum votes for statehood were matched almost equally by votes for remaining an American territory with the remainder for independence Support for U S statehood has risen in each successive popular referendum br The fifth Puerto Rican status referendum of was held on June and offered three options Statehood Independence Free Association and Current Territorial Status With of registered voters casting ballots voted for statehood Benefits of statehood would include an additional billion per year in federal funds the right to vote in presidential elections higher Social Security and Medicare benefits and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy The latter is currently prohibited br Even with the Puerto Ricans vote for statehood action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution br br br See also br br Demographics of Puerto Rico br Hispanics br Criollo
