Leather is a strong flexible and durable material obtained from the tanning or chemical treatment of animal skins and hides to prevent decay The most common leathers come from cattle sheep goats equine animals buffalo pigs and hogs and aquatic animals such as seals and alligators br Leather can be used to make a variety of items including clothing footwear handbags furniture tools and sports equipment and lasts for decades Leather making has been practiced for more than years and the leading producers of leather today are China and India br Critics of tanneries claim that they engage in unsustainable practices that pose health hazards to the people and the environment near them br br The leather manufacturing process is divided into three fundamental subprocesses preparatory stages tanning and crusting A further subprocess finishing can be added into the leather process sequence but not all leathers receive finishing br The preparatory stages are when the hide is prepared for tanning Preparatory stages may include soaking hair removal liming deliming bating bleaching and pickling br Tanning is a process that stabilizes the proteins particularly collagen of the raw hide to increase the thermal chemical and microbiological stability of the hides and skins making it suitable for a wide variety of end applications The principal difference between raw and tanned hides is that raw hides dry out to form a hard inflexible material that when rewetted will putrefy while tanned material dries to a flexible form that does not become putrid when rewetted br Many tanning methods and materials exist The typical process sees tanners load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a tank that contains the tanning liquor The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis and the tanning liquor slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide Once the process achieves even penetration workers slowly raise the liquor s pH in a process called basification which fixes the tanning material to the leather The more tanning material fixed the higher the leather s hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance br Crusting is a process that thins and lubricates leather It often includes a coloring operation Chemicals added during crusting must be fixed in place Crusting culminates with a drying and softening operation and may include splitting shaving dyeing whitening or other methods br For some leathers tanners apply a surface coating called finishing Finishing operations can include oiling brushing buffing coating polishing embossing glazing or tumbling among others br Leather can be oiled to improve its water resistance This currying process after tanning supplements the natural oils remaining in the leather itself which can be washed out through repeated exposure to water Frequent oiling of leather with mink oil neatsfoot oil or a similar material keeps it supple and improves its lifespan dramatically br br Tanning processes largely differ in which chemicals are used in the tanning liquor Some common types include br br Vegetable tanned leather is tanned using tannins extracted from vegetable matter such as tree bark prepared in bark mills It is the oldest known method It is supple and light brown in color with the exact shade depending on the mix of materials and the color of the skin The color tan derives its name from the appearance of undyed vegetable tanned leather Vegetable tanned leather is not stable in water it tends to discolor and if left to soak and then dry it shrinks and becomes harder a feature of vegetable tanned leather that is exploited in traditional shoemaking In hot water it shrinks drastically and partly congeals becoming rigid and eventually brittle Boiled leather is an example of this where the leather has been hardened by being immersed in boiling water or in wax or similar substances Historically it was occasionally used as armor after hardening and it has also been used for book binding br Chrome tanned leather is tanned using chromium sulfate and other chromium salts It is also known as wet blue for the pale blue color of the undyed leather The chrome tanning method usually takes approximately one day to complete making it best suited for large scale industrial use This is the most common method in modern use It is more supple and pliable than vegetable tanned leather and does not discolor or lose shape as drastically in water as vegetable tanned However there are environmental concerns with this tanning method as chromium is a heavy metal while the trivalent chromium used for tanning is harmless other byproducts can contain toxic variants The method was developed in the latter half of the th century as tanneries wanted to find ways to speed up the process and to make leather more waterproof br Aldehyde tanned leather is tanned using glutaraldehyde or oxazolidine compounds It is referred to as wet white due to its pale cream color It is the main type of chrome free leather often seen in shoes for infants and automobiles Formaldehyde has been used for tanning in the past it is being phased out due to danger to workers and sensitivity of many people to formaldehyde Chamois leather is a form of aldehyde tanned leather that is porous and highly water absorbent Chamois leather is made using oil traditionally cod oil that oxidizes to produce the aldehydes that tan the leather br Brain tanned leathers are made by a labor intensive process that uses emulsified oils often those of animal brains such as deer cattle and buffalo An example of this kind is buckskin Leather products made in this manner are known for their exceptional softness and washability br Alum leather is transformed using aluminium salts mixed with a variety of binders and protein sources such as flour and egg yolk Alum leather is not actually tanned rather the process is called tawing and the resulting material reverts to rawhide if soaked in water long enough to remove the alum salts br br In general leather is produced in the following grades br br Top grain leather includes the outer layer of the hide known as the grain which features finer more densely packed fibers resulting in strength and durability Depending on thickness it may also contain some of the more fibrous under layer known as the corium Types of top grain leather include br Full grain leather contains the entire grain layer without any removal of the surface Rather than wearing out it develops a patina during its useful lifetime It is usually considered the highest quality leather Furniture and footwear are often made from full grain leather Full grain leather is typically finished with a soluble aniline dye Russia leather is a form of full grain leather br Corrected grain leather has the surface subjected to finishing treatments to create a more uniform appearance This usually involves buffing or sanding away flaws in the grain then dyeing and embossing the surface br Nubuck is top grain leather that has been sanded or buffed on the grain side to give a slight nap of short protein fibers producing a velvet like surface br Split leather is created from the corium left once the top grain has been separated from the hide known as the drop split In thicker hides the drop split can be further split into a middle split and a flesh split br Bicast leather is split leather that is coated with a layer of polyurethane or vinyl with an embossed texture This gives it the appearance of a grain It is slightly stiffer than top grain leather but has a more consistent texture br Patent leather is leather that has been given a high gloss finish by the addition of a coating Dating to the late s it became widely popular after inventor Seth Boyden developed the first mass production process using a linseed oil based lacquer in Modern versions are usually a form of bicast leather br Suede is made from the underside of a split to create a soft napped finish It is often made from younger or smaller animals as the skins of adults often result in a coarse shaggy nap br Bonded leather also called reconstituted leather is a material that uses leather scraps that are shredded and bonded together with polyurethane or latex onto a fiber mesh The amount of leather fibers in the mix varies from to affecting the properties of the product br The term genuine leather does not describe a specific grade The term often indicates split leather that has been extensively processed and some sources describe it as synonymous with bicast leather or made from multiple splits glued together and coated In some countries when it is the description on a product label the term means nothing more than contains leather depending on jurisdiction regulations limit the term s use in product labelling br br Today most leather is made of cattle hides which constitute about of all leather produced Other animals that are used include sheep about goats about and pigs about Obtaining accurate figures from around the world is difficult especially for areas where the skin may be eaten There are significant regional differences in leather production i e goat leather was historically called Turkey or Morocco due to its association with the Middle East while pig skin had historically been used the most in Germany Other animals mentioned below only constitute a fraction of a percent of total leather production br Horse hides are used to make particularly durable leathers Shell cordovan is a horse leather made not from the outer skin but from an under layer found only in equine species called the shell It is prized for its mirror like finish and anti creasing properties br Lamb and deerskin are used for soft leather in more expensive apparel Deerskin is widely used in work gloves and indoor shoes br Reptilian skins such as alligator crocodile and snake are noted for their distinct patterns that reflect the scales of their species This has led to hunting and farming of these species in part for their skins The Argentine black and white tegu is one of the most exploited reptile species in the world in the leather trade However it is not endangered and while monitored trade is legal in most South American countries br Kangaroo leather is used to make items that must be strong and flexible It is the material most commonly used in bullwhips Some motorcyclists favor kangaroo leather for motorcycle leathers because of its light weight and abrasion resistance Kangaroo leather is also used for falconry jesses soccer footwear e g Adidas Copa Mundial and boxing speed bags br br Although originally raised for their feathers in the th century ostriches are now more popular for both meat and leather Ostrich leather has a characteristic goose bump look because of the large follicles where the feathers grew Different processes produce different finishes for many applications including upholstery footwear automotive products accessories and clothing br In Thailand stingray leather is used in wallets and belts Stingray leather is tough and durable The leather is often dyed black and covered with tiny round bumps in the natural pattern of the back ridge of an animal These bumps are then usually dyed white to highlight the decoration Stingray rawhide is also used as grips on Chinese swords Scottish basket hilted swords and Japanese katanas Stingray leather is also used for high abrasion areas in motorcycle racing leathers especially in gloves where its high abrasion resistance helps prevent wear through in the event of an accident br For a given thickness fish leather is typically much stronger due to its criss crossed fibers br br Leather produces some environmental impact most notably due to br br The carbon footprint of cattle rearing see environmental impact of meat production br Use of chemicals in the tanning process e g chromium phthalate esters nonyl phenol ethoxylate soaps pentachlorophenol and solvents br Air pollution due to the transformation process hydrogen sulfide is formed during mixing with acids and ammonia liberated during deliming solvent vapors br br Estimates of the carbon footprint of bovine leather range from to kg of CO equivalent per square meter of production br br One ton of hide or skin generally produces to m of waste water including chromium levels of mg L sulfide levels of br mg L high levels of fat and other solid wastes and notable pathogen contamination Producers often add pesticides to protect hides during transport With solid wastes representing up to of the wet weight of the original hides the tanning process represents a considerable strain on water treatment installations br br Leather biodegrades slowly taking to years to decompose However vinyl and petrochemical derived materials take or more years to decompose br br Tanning is especially polluting in countries where environmental regulations are lax such as in India the world s third largest producer and exporter of leather To give an example of an efficient pollution prevention system chromium loads per produced tonne are generally abated from kg to kg VOC emissions are typically reduced from kg t to kg t in a properly managed facility A review of the total pollution load decrease achievable according to the United Nations Industrial Development Organization posts precise data on the abatement achievable through industrially proven low waste advanced methods while noting even though the chrome pollution load can be decreased by on introducing advanced technologies the minimum residual load kg t raw hide can still cause difficulties when using landfills and composting sludge from wastewater treatment on account of the regulations currently in force in some countries br In Kanpur the self proclaimed Leather City of World with tanneries as of and a city of three million on the banks of the Ganges pollution levels were so high that despite an industry crisis the pollution control board decided to shut down high polluting tanneries out of in July In for instance the main tanneries effluent disposal unit was dumping tonnes of chromium laden solid waste per day in the open br In the Hazaribagh neighborhood of Dhaka in Bangladesh chemicals from tanneries end up in Dhaka s main river Besides the environmental damage the health of both local factory workers and the end consumer is also negatively affected After approximately years of ignoring high court rulings the government shut down more than tanneries the weekend of April in the neighborhood br The higher cost associated with the treatment of effluents than to untreated effluent discharging leads to illegal dumping to save on costs For instance in Croatia in proper pollution abatement cost US per ton of raw hides processed against t for irresponsible behavior In November one of Uganda s main leather making companies was caught directly dumping waste water into a wetland adjacent to Lake Victoria br br Enzymes like proteases lipases and amylases have an important role in the soaking dehairing degreasing and bating operations of leather manufacturing Proteases are the most commonly used enzymes in leather production The enzyme must not damage or dissolve collagen or keratin but should hydrolyze casein elastin albumin globulin like proteins and nonstructural proteins that are not essential for leather making This process is called bating br Lipases are used in the degreasing operation to hydrolyze fat particles embedded in the skin br Amylases are used to soften skin to bring out the grain and to impart strength and flexibility to the skin These enzymes are rarely used br br The natural fibers of leather break down with the passage of time Acidic leathers are particularly vulnerable to red rot which causes powdering of the surface and a change in consistency Damage from red rot is aggravated by high temperatures and relative humidities Although it is chemically irreversible treatments can add handling strength and prevent disintegration of red rotted leather br Exposure to long periods of low relative humidities below can cause leather to become desiccated irreversibly changing the fibrous structure of the leather Chemical damage can also occur from exposure to environmental factors including ultraviolet light ozone acid from sulfurous and nitrous pollutants in the air or through a chemical action following any treatment with tallow or oil compounds Both oxidation and chemical damage occur faster at higher temperatures br There are few methods to maintain and clean leather goods properly such as using damp cloth and avoid using a wet cloth or soaking the leather in water Various treatments are available such as conditioners Saddle soap is used for cleaning conditioning and softening leather Leather shoes are widely conditioned with shoe polish br br Due to its excellent resistance to abrasion and wind leather found a use in rugged occupations The enduring image of a cowboy in leather chaps gave way to the leather jacketed and leather helmeted aviator When motorcycles were invented some riders took to wearing heavy leather jackets to protect from road rash and wind blast some also wear chaps or full leather pants to protect the lower body br Leather s flexibility allows it to be formed and shaped into balls and protective gear Subsequently many sports use equipment made with leather such as baseball gloves and the ball used in cricket and gridiron football br Leather fetishism is the name popularly used to describe a fetishistic attraction to people wearing leather or in certain cases to the garments themselves br Many rock groups particularly heavy metal and punk groups in the s and s are well known for wearing leather clothing Extreme metal bands especially black metal bands and Goth rock groups have extensive black leather clothing Leather has become less common in the punk community over the last three decades as there is opposition to the use of leather from punks who support animal rights br Many cars and trucks come with optional or standard leather or leather faced seating br br In countries with significant populations of individuals observing religions which place restrictions on material choices vendors typically clarify the source of leather in their products Such labeling helps facilitate religious observance so for example a Muslim will not accidentally purchase pigskin or a Hindu can avoid cattleskin Such taboos increase the demand for religiously neutral leathers such as ostrich and deer br Judaism forbids the comfort of wearing leather shoes on Yom Kippur Tisha B Av and during mourning Also see Leather in Judaism Teffilin and Torah Scroll br Jainism prohibits the use of leather since it is obtained by killing animals br br Many forms of artificial leather have been developed usually involving polyurethane or vinyl coatings applied to a cloth backing Many names and brands for such artificial leathers exist including pleather a portmanteau of plastic leather and the brand name Naugahyde br Another alternative is cultured leather which is lab grown using cell culture methods mushroom based materials and gelatin based textile made by upcycling meat industry waste Leather made of fungi or mushroom based materials are
