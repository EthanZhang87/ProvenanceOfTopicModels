A keyboard instrument is a musical instrument played using a keyboard a row of levers that are pressed by the fingers The most common of these are the piano organ and various electronic keyboards including synthesizers and digital pianos Other keyboard instruments include celestas which are struck idiophones operated by a keyboard and carillons which are usually housed in bell towers or belfries of churches or municipal buildings br Today the term keyboard often refers to keyboard style synthesizers and arrangers as well as work stations These keyboards typically work by translating the physical act of pressing keys into electrical signals that produce sound Under the fingers of a sensitive performer the keyboard may also be used to control dynamics phrasing shading articulation and other elements of expression depending on the design and inherent capabilities of the instrument Modern keyboards especially digital ones can simulate a wide range of sounds beyond traditional piano tones thanks to advanced sound synthesis techniques and digital sampling technology br Another important use of the word keyboard is in historical musicology where it means an instrument whose identity cannot be firmly established Particularly in the th century the harpsichord the clavichord and the early piano competed and the same piece might be played on more than one Hence in a phrase such as Mozart excelled as a keyboard player the word keyboard is typically all inclusive br The term keyboard classifies instruments based on how the performer plays the instrument and not on how the sound is produced Categories of keyboard instruments include the following families of which this is only a partial list br br aerophones pipe organ pump organ accordion br idiophones celesta carillon glasschord br chordophones br plucked string instruments harpsichord tangent piano lautenwerck br bowed string instruments hurdy gurdy bowed clavier br struck string instruments clavichord piano br electrophones electric pianos electric and electronic organs synthesizers mellotron br br br History br br The earliest known keyboard instrument was the Ancient Greek hydraulis a type of pipe organ invented in the third century BC The keys were likely balanced and could be played with a light touch as is clear from the reference in a Latin poem by Claudian late th century who says magna levi detrudens murmura tactu intonet that is let him thunder forth as he presses out mighty roarings with a light touch Paneg Manlio Theodoro From its invention until the fourteenth century the organ remained the only keyboard instrument Often the organ did not feature a keyboard at all but rather buttons or large levers operated by a whole hand Almost every keyboard until the fifteenth century had seven naturals to each octave br The clavicymbalum clavichord and the harpsichord appeared during the fourteenth century the clavichord probably being earlier The harpsichord and clavichord were both common until the widespread adoption of the piano in the eighteenth century after which their popularity decreased The first template for the modern piano was introduced in in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori as the gravic mbalo con piano e forte harpsichord with soft and loud also shortened to pianoforte as it allowed the pianist to control the dynamics by adjusting the force with which each key was struck In its current form the piano is a product of further developments made since the late nineteenth century and is distinct in both sound and appearance from the instruments known to earlier pianists including Mozart Haydn and Beethoven Beginning in the twentieth century early electromechanical instruments such as the Ondes Martenot began to appear as well Later in the th century electronic keyboards appeared br br br See also br Enharmonic keyboard br Hammered dulcimer br Keyboard percussion br Musical keyboard br Orchestrina di camera br br br br br br Further reading br Young Percy M Keyboard Musicians of the World London Abelard Schuman N B Concerns celebrated keyboard players and the various such instruments used over the centuries ISBN X br br br External links br br The general keyboard in the age of MIDI br Renaissance Keyboards on the Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History The Metropolitan Museum of Art br The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori on the Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History The Metropolitan Museum of Art
