Wikidata is a collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation It is a common source of open data that Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia and anyone else is able to use under the CC public domain license Wikidata is a wiki powered by the software MediaWiki including its extension for semi structured data the Wikibase As of early Wikidata had billion item statements semantic triple br br br Concept br br Wikidata is a document oriented database focusing on items which represent any kind of topic concept or object Each item is allocated a unique persistent identifier a positive integer prefixed with the upper case letter Q known as a QID Q is the starting letter of the first name of Qamarniso Vrande i n e Ismoilova an Uzbek Wikimedian married to the Wikidata co developer Denny Vrande i This enables the basic information required to identify the topic that the item covers to be translated without favouring any language br Examples of items include Summer Olympics Q love Q Johnny Cash Q Elvis Presley Q and Gorilla Q br Item labels do not need to be unique For example there are two items named Elvis Presley Elvis Presley Q which represents the American singer and actor and Elvis Presley Q which represents his self titled album However the combination of a label and its description must be unique To avoid ambiguity an item s unique identifier QID is hence linked to this combination br br br Main parts br br Fundamentally an item consists of br br An identifier the QID related to a label and a description br Optionally multiple aliases and some number of statements and their properties and values br br br Statements br br Statements are how any information known about an item is recorded in Wikidata Formally they consist of key value pairs which match a property such as author or publication date with one or more entity values such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or For example the informal English statement milk is white would be encoded by a statement pairing the property color P with the value white Q under the item milk Q br Statements may map a property to more than one value For example the occupation property for Marie Curie could be linked with the values physicist and chemist to reflect the fact that she engaged in both occupations br Values may take on many types including other Wikidata items strings numbers or media files Properties prescribe what types of values they may be paired with For example the property official website P may only be paired with values of type URL br Optionally qualifiers can be used to refine the meaning of a statement by providing additional information For example a population statement could be modified with a qualifier such as point in time P as its own key value pair Values in the statements may also be annotated with references pointing to a source backing up the statement s content As with statements all qualifiers and references are property value pairs br br br Properties br br Each property has a numeric identifier prefixed with a capital P and a page on Wikidata with optional label description aliases and statements As such there are properties with the sole purpose of describing other properties such as subproperty of P br Properties may also define more complex rules about their intended usage termed constraints For example the capital P property includes a single value constraint reflecting the reality that typically territories have only one capital city Constraints are treated as testing alerts and hints rather than inviolable rules br Before a new property is created it needs to undergo a discussion process br The most used property is cites work P which is used on more than item pages as of November br br br Lexemes br In linguistics a lexeme is a unit of lexical meaning Similarly Wikidata s lexemes are items with a structure that makes them more suitable to store lexicographical data Besides storing the language to which the lexeme refers they have a section for forms and a section for senses br br br Entity Schemas br In January development started of a new extension for MediaWiki to enable storing Shape Expressions in a separate namespace br This extension has since been installed on Wikidata and enables contributors to use Shape Expressions for validating and describing Resource Description Framework data in items and lexemes Any item or lexeme on Wikidata can be validated against an Entity Schema and this makes it an important tool for quality assurance br br br Content br br Wikidata s content collections include data for biographies medicine digital humanities scholarly metadata through the WikiCite project br It includes data collections from other open projects including Freebase database br br br Development br The creation of the project was funded by donations from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and Google Inc totaling million The development of the project is mainly driven by Wikimedia Deutschland under the management of Lydia Pintscher and was originally split into three phases br br Centralising interlanguage links links between Wikipedia articles about the same topic in different languages br Providing a central place for infobox data for all Wikipedias br Creating and updating list articles based on data in Wikidata and linking to other Wikimedia sister projects including Meta Wiki and the own Wikidata interwikilinks br br br Initial rollout br br Wikidata was launched on October and was the first new project of the Wikimedia Foundation since At this time only the centralization of language links was available This enabled items to be created and filled with basic information a label a name or title aliases alternative terms for the label a description and links to articles about the topic in all the various language editions of Wikipedia interwikipedia links br Historically a Wikipedia article would include a list of interlanguage links links to articles on the same topic in other editions of Wikipedia if they existed Wikidata was originally a self contained repository of interlanguage links Wikipedia language editions were still not able to access Wikidata so they needed to continue to maintain their own lists of interlanguage links br On January the Hungarian Wikipedia became the first to enable the provision of interlanguage links via Wikidata This functionality was extended to the Hebrew and Italian Wikipedias on January to the English Wikipedia on February and to all other Wikipedias on March After no consensus was reached over a proposal to restrict the removal of language links from the English Wikipedia they were automatically removed by bots On September interlanguage links went live on Wikimedia Commons br br br Statements and data access br On February statements were introduced to Wikidata entries The possible values for properties were initially limited to two data types items and images on Wikimedia Commons with more data types such as coordinates and dates to follow later The first new type string was deployed on March br The ability for the various language editions of Wikipedia to access data from Wikidata was rolled out progressively between March and April On September Wikidata began allowing so called arbitrary access or access from a given article of a Wikipedia to the statements on Wikidata items not directly connected to it For example it became possible to read data about Germany from the Berlin article which was not feasible before On April arbitrary access was activated on Wikimedia Commons br According to a study a large proportion of the data on Wikidata consists of entries imported en masse from other databases by Internet bots which helps to break down the walls of data silos br br br Query service and other improvements br On September the Wikimedia Foundation announced the release of the Wikidata Query Service which lets users run queries on the data contained in Wikidata The service uses SPARQL as the query language As of November there are at least different tools that allow querying the data in different ways It uses Blazegraph as its triplestore and graph database br In Wikimedia Deutschland released the Query Builder a form based query builder to allow people who don t know how to use SPARQL to write a query br br br Logo br The bars on the logo contain the word WIKI encoded in Morse code It was created by Arun Ganesh and selected through community decision br br br Reception br In November Wikidata received the Open Data Publisher Award from the Open Data Institute for sheer scale and built in openness br In December Google announced that it would shut down Freebase in favor of Wikidata br As of November Wikidata information was used in of all English Wikipedia articles mostly for external identifiers or coordinate locations In aggregate data from Wikidata is shown in of all Wikipedias pages of all Wikivoyage articles of all Wikiquotes of all Wikisources and of Wikimedia Commons br As of December Wikidata s data was visualized by at least other external tools and over papers have been published about Wikidata br br br Applications br Wikidata s structured dataset has been used by virtual assistants such as Apple s Siri and Amazon Alexa br Mwnci extension can import data from Wikidata to LibreOffice Calc spreadsheets br KDE Itinerary a privacy conscious open source travel assistant that uses data from Wikidata br Google originally started a frame semantic parser project that aims to parse the information on Wikipedia and transfer it into Wikidata by coming up with relevant statements using artificial intelligence br MathQA a mathematical question answering system br A systematic literature review of the uses of Wikidata in research was carried out in br br br See also br br Abstract
