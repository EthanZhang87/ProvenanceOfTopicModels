A watercraft or waterborne vessel is any vehicle designed for travel across or through water bodies such as a boat ship hovercraft submersible or submarine br br br Types br Watercraft can be grouped into surface vessels which include ships yachts boats hydroplanes wingships unmanned surface vehicles sailboards and human powered craft such as rafts canoes kayaks and paddleboards underwater vessels which include submarines submersibles unmanned underwater vehicles UUVs wet subs and diver propulsion vehicles and amphibious vehicles which include hovercraft car boats amphibious ATVs and seaplanes Many of these watercraft have a variety of subcategories and are used for different needs and applications br br br Design br br The design of watercraft requires a tradeoff among internal capacity tonnage speed and seaworthiness Tonnage is important for transport of goods speed is important for warships and racing vessels and the degree of seaworthiness varies according to the bodies of water on which a watercraft is used Regulations apply to larger watercraft to avoid foundering at sea and other problems Design technologies include the use of computer modeling and ship model basin testing before construction br br br Propulsion br br Watercraft propulsion can be divided into five categories br br Water power is used by drifting with a river current or a tidal stream An anchor or weight may be lowered to provide enough steerage way to keep in the best part of the current as in drudging or paddles or poles might be used to keep position br Human effort is used through a pole pushing against the bottom of shallow water or paddles or oars operating in the surface of the water br Wind power is used by sails br Towing is used either from the land such as the bank of a canal with the motive power provided by draught animals humans or machinery or one watercraft may tow another br Mechanical propulsion uses a motor whose power is derived from burning a fuel or stored energy such as batteries This power is commonly converted into propulsion by propellers or by water jets with paddle wheels being a largely historical method br Any one watercraft might use more than one of these methods at different times or in conjunction with each other For instance early steamships often set sails to work alongside the engine power Before steam tugs became common sailing vessels would back and fill their sails to maintain a good position in a tidal stream while drifting with the tide in or out of a river In a modern yacht motor sailing travelling under the power of both sails and engine is a common method of making progress if only in and out of harbour br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br The Canadian Museum of Civilization Native Watercraft in Canada br A History of Recreational Small Watercraft Archived at the Wayback Machine br Recreational Watercraft
