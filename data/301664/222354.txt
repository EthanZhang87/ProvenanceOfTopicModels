Windsurfing is a wind propelled water sport that is a combination of sailing and surfing It is also referred to as sailboarding and boardsailing and emerged in the late s from the Californian aerospace and surf culture Windsurfing gained a popular following across Europe and North America by the late s and had achieved significant global popularity by the s Windsurfing became an Olympic sport in br Newer variants include windfoiling kiteboarding and wingfoiling Hydrofoil fins under the board allow the boards to safely lift out of the water and fly silently and smoothly above the surface even in lighter winds br Windsurfing is a recreational family friendly sport most popular at flat water locations around the world that offer safety and accessibility for beginner and intermediate participants Technique and equipment have evolved over the years br Major competitive disciplines include slalom wave and freestyle Increasingly foiling is replacing traditional events and the IQfoil class is the new Olympic windsurfing racing class for France in br br br History br Jim Drake invented and co patented windsurfing in California between and Alternative concepts by Englishman Peter Chilvers and American Newman Darby are recognized as earlier sailboards Drake was educated and trained as an aeronautical engineer at Stanford University He spent his early years surfing sailing and skiing He conceived windsurfing to combine the simplicity of skiing with the pleasures of sailing Drake is known historically as The Father of Windsurfing Drake s patented invention was marketed and sold under the brand name Windsurfer for over years by a company he cofounded with businessman Hoyle Schweitzer called Windsurfing International br Windsurfing s popularity saw explosive growth in the s and s Initially in Europe then in North America The sport began to take off in popularity around and by the end of the s it was the fastest growing sport in the world Originally all windsurfing boards were long boards This type of board went relatively slower through the water but worked well in low wind conditions Light air long board windsurfing was enjoyed by a wide range of participants including families with young children br During the s a global community consisting of equipment designers manufacturers athletes travel professionals and journalists worked together to propel windsurfing forward Innovation allowed for the development of stiff light weight planing short boards foot straps harnesses and more stable sails Windsurfing shattered the world speed sailing record Windsurfing s retail momentum eventually slowed with the arrival of newer action sports By the s closely related action sports such as mountain biking snowboarding stand up paddle boarding SUP and kite boarding all directly competed for popularity with windsurfing Many windsurfing schools closed or switched to teaching kite boarding and currently teach mostly wing foiling br After some lean years in the s the sport has seen a steady revival through the explosion of foiling br br br The inventors br br Modern windsurfing as a sport and recreational activity did not emerge until the latter half of the th century The earliest version of a sailboard design utilizing a freely articulating sail on top of a board was created in by American Newman Darby Independently engineer Jim Drake invented and co patented the version we all know today and called it Windsurfing a new new concept in sailing br Long before this modern moment there were small scale sailing craft that have used wind as the driving force many of them sourced to the Polynesians who have been riding the wind and waves for centuries Early accounts suggest island peoples were undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail In the early th century people in logging communities around western Lake Michigan were purportedly fixing sails to logs as part of log float control and for recreation br In year old Newman Darby was the first to conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a universal joint so that he could control his small catamaran the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail fore and aft Darby filed for a patent but lacked the funds to resubmit However he is widely recognized as its inventor as well as the first to conceive design and build a sailboard with a universal joint In his own words Darby experimented throughout much of the s and s and it was not until that an improved sailboard with a conventional stayed sloop rig sail arrangement made it more stable than the one built in S Newman Darby created his first product for a wider market in that he called the Darby sailboard on the Susquehanna River Pennsylvania United States br While Darby s sailboard incorporated a pivoting rig it was square rigged or kite rigged and was subject to the associated limitations Unlike the modern windsurfer design Darby s sailboard was operated back winded with the sailor s back to the lee side of a kite shaped sail This is a much less efficient and less dynamic sailing position and opposite of how a modern windsurfer is operated Darby s article stated that you can learn to master a type of maneuvering that s been dead since the age of the picturesque square riggers He began selling his sailboards in The main focus of his company Darby Industries was to sell plans such that any school age child could build one for under Rather than building personal wealth his focus was to introduce youth to the sport of sailing in even very shallow water A promotional article by Darby was published in the August edition of Popular Science magazine Darby died in reportedly feeling pleased with the recognition he received for having created an early version of the sailboard br Twelve year old Peter Chilvers is also cited for inventing a kind of sailboard in England in br br Stanford educated aeronautical engineer Jim Drake and fellow aeronautical engineer Fred Payne conceived and designed a sail powered surfboard in Their version differed from Darby s in many significant ways The sailor stood upright on a large surfboard while holding directly onto the windward side of a small triangular sail Originally they designed it to be propelled by a hand held wing rather than an attached masted sail Soon they decided a universal joint attaching a movable sail was more practical br After learning of Drake s revolutionary sailing concept one of Drake s family friends a businessman named Hoyle Schweitzer became interested in marketing Drake s new invention As a businessman Schweitzer imagined the profit potential and encouraged Drake to build a functional prototype for product testing Later when Drake s prototype worked he helped Drake to patent the idea From the outset the two men were motivated by different forces Drake conceptualized engineered built and tested the first windsurfer Schweitzer while not directly involved in the invention helped by organizing the business details of patenting marketing and selling Drake s new craft As a partnership Drake came up with the original concept and Schweitzer marketed and sold it Both men s names appear on the patent br Years later in when the Professional Windsurfing Association PWA inducted both Drake and Schweitzer into the Windsurfing Hall of Fame they called Drake The Father of Windsurfing for his role as inventor and egalitarian figure head throughout his lifetime and called Schweitzer the man who brought windsurfing to the masses based on his efforts to promote the Windsurfer brand s popularity It was a brief but productive collaboration between a talented engineer and a motivated businessman that together created the modern sport of windsurfing Drake has stated in various interviews that he recognizes Darby and Chilvers as early sailboard pioneers and sees himself as the sports re inventor br br br Drake s first prototype the Windsurfer name br Drake is known historically as one of the world s top aeronautical engineers He was also an expert craftsman in his spare time He combined both skills to conceive and build the world s first windsurfer prototype First he carefully engineered a mathematical simulation of his concept based on the physics of windsurfing He then crafted nearly all of the windsurfer prototype components by hand in his Santa Monica California home garage in January He built the wishbone boom daggerboard and mast foot from laminated strips of teak wood He custom designed and built a wood press jig for shaping the curve into the wishbone boom The universal joint was built by reconfiguring a commercially available sailboat swivel joint constructed from heavy duty marine stainless steel with additional teflon components Drake engineered the custom sail which was made from Dacron sail cloth and cut and sewn by sail maker Bob Broussard into a triangular Bermuda rig The custom board Drake engineered required a greater amount of displacement volume for floatation than was found in a traditional surfboard so an extra large custom built foam blank was constructed by Gordon Grubby Clark of Clark foam and shaped by Jim Drake and Gary Seaman at the Con Surfboard factory in Santa Monica California A repurposed hollow fiberglass mast was taken from a small Flipper racing dingy rig br br To gather the needed materials Drake carefully instructed Schweitzer what raw materials to purchase such as an extra large foam blank to build the board and a hollow fiberglass mast for the sail Drake completed construction of the prototype in his own garage during his spare time within a few months br Drake s question came down to simple operation of how a standing person could control both the power of the sail as well as the direction of the craft without a rudder Drake discovered that one s ability to rotate the sail s position relative to the board could allow control of both power and direction Experimenting with a rotational design he invented the concept for the universal joint Drake completed his engineering concept with a wishbone boom a daggerboard mast mast foot triangular sail and fin Interestingly because Drake always envisioned in his mind the sailor standing on the board with the sail in their hands he originally forgot to include a rope now called an uphaul which allows the sailor to pull the sail from the water His first day on the water was made more difficult without this essential item but by the second day he had invented that part as well br On May Jim Drake along with his wife Wendy and daughter Stephanie went to Marina del Rey s Jamaica Bay to make history with the world s first modern sailboard br Returning to Marina del Rey one week later this time with the skeg and uphaul Drake succeeded at sailing the board the way he designed it to be used With his confidence buoyed from multiple days of practice in the protected bay Drake next took his sailboard onto the open ocean at Will Rogers State Beach in Santa Monica California Drake subsequently taught Schweitzer how to windsurf and soon the sport was launched br br Originally Drake and Schweitzer wanted to name their new sailboard concept Skate SK however changed the name to Baja Board in early Schweitzer was marketing a prototype of the Baja Board in Seattle when Bert Salisbury stopped his car to have a look and commented Gee I have the perfect name for it Windsurfing The name was soon changed to Windsurfer sold by the company Windsurfing International br The details of Jim Drake s original windsurfing concept were published in by Drake s employer at the time the RAND Corporation in a technical paper written and presented by him titled Windsurfing A New Concept in Sailing Further details can be read in published interviews Despite forty years of subsequent development the design is still remarkably similar to today s windsurfing equipment and the word windsurfer has become synonymous with the sport itself br br br The sport s first company br Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer together started the sport s first company Windsurfing International in late out of Drake s Santa Monica California home Both men were employed full time outside of their startup windsurfing business and so windsurfing was little more than an experimental hobby for them at that time Drake and his wife Wendy along with Schweitzer and his wife Diane worked closely together in their spare time to create a marketable framework for the new sport Drake and Schweitzer collaborated informally as friends rather than legally bound business partners as no formal business partnership was ever signed between them Unexpectedly Drake was temporarily relocated miles away to design innovative rocket planes at The Pentagon Around this same time Schweitzer lost his job as a computer software salesman br While Drake was away for two years immersed in engineering work on the other side of the country Schweitzer began manufacturing and selling Windsurfers as well as incorporating the company Windsurfing International and collected licensing fees on over boards in Europe without ever informing or including Drake Schweitzer concealed from Drake the somewhat large profits he was beginning to make from selling the boards Drake had invented Observers close to the situation believe it was always Schweitzer s plan to keep Drake uniformed of the large profit potential long enough to misrepresent and under value the real worth of the patent so that Schweitzer could buy out Drake s half of the patent for as little as possible When Drake later discovered Schweitzer s unethical and dishonest actions he was deeply confused and angered Drake who trusted Schweitzer and his family was shocked that his friend would deceive him in this unkind way Drake originally was not interested in forfeiting his half of the patent However Schweitzer and his attorneys would continue for years to aggressively pressure Drake to sell his half of the patent to Windsurfing International in order for Schweitzer to secure a lucrative monopoly on all future royalties br br Windsurfing International registered the term Windsurfer as a trademark at the United States Patent and Trademark Office in Windsurfing International Inc created a popular one design racing class which was influenced by the desire to provide a fleet of racers with a uniformly constructed boat so that rider skill rather than equipment choice would determine competitive results The first Windsurfer Class World Championship regatta took place in San Diego California in The Windsurfer Class fleet was based the success of the Laser and Hobie Cat classes Each Windsurfer had an identical computer cut sail a technology new at that time and pioneered by Ian Bruce br br br Patent disputes br On March Jim Drake an aeronautical engineer and Hoyle Schweitzer a businessman filed the very first windsurfing patent which was granted by the USPTO in br Through the seventies and early eighties windsurfing was the fastest growing sport on earth Schweitzer aggressively protected his patent around the world through Sub licensing the rights to anyone who wanted to manufacture and sell sailboards Windsurfing International s usurious royalty fee charges which its competitors were forced to pay were so high that many observers felt it needlessly limited the growth of the sport Mr Schweitzer claimed this was to promote his brand and the Windsurfer One Design racing class but most believed it was so he could maximize his own profits The sport underwent very rapid growth however particularly in Europe after the sale of a sub license sold to Ten Cate Sports in the Netherlands In Ten Cate Sports sold boards in Europe br At the same time Schweitzer also sought to defend his patent rights vigorously against unauthorized manufacturers This led to a host of predating windsurfer like devices being presented to courts around the world by companies disputing Windsurfing International s rights to the invention br In Schweitzer licensed Brittany France based company Dufour Wing which was later merged with Tabur Marine the precursor of Bic Sport Europe was now the largest growing market for windsurfers and the sub licensed companies Tabur F Mistral wanted to find a way to remove or reduce their royalty payments to Windsurfing International br Tabur lawyers found prior art in a local English newspaper which had published a story with a picture about Peter Chilvers who as a young boy on Hayling Island on the south coast of England assembled his first board combined with a sail in This board used a universal joint one of the key parts of the Windsurfing International s patent They also found stories published about the invention of the sailboard by Newman Darby and his wife Naomi in Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania br In Windsurfing International Inc v Tabur Marine GB Ltd RPC with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fan Baron Marcel Bich British courts recognized the prior art of Peter Chilvers It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms of the modern windsurfer but rather a straight boom that became curved in use The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was merely an obvious extension This court case set a precedent for patent law in the United Kingdom in terms of inventive step and non obviousness the court upheld the defendant s claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid based on film footage of Chilvers Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake and Schweitzer lost again After the cases no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International any royalty payments the now renamed Bic Sport became one of the world s larger producers of windsurfing equipment with an annual production of boards br There is no evidence that Schweitzer or Drake had knowledge of any prior inventions similar to theirs Drake accepted in retrospect that although he can be credited with the invention he was probably no better than third behind mid west based Newman Darby and Englishman Peter Chilvers The battle over the origin story of the sport would go on to cause much legal grief for the global sporting phenomenon for much of the s br In Schweitzer sued Swiss board manufacturer Mistral and lost Mistral s defense hinged on the work of US inventor Newman Darby who by conceived the sailboard a hand held square rigged kite sail on a floating platform for recreational use br Eventually US courts recognized the Schweitzer windsurfer as an obvious step from Darby s prior art Schweitzer had to reapply for a patent under severely limited terms and finally it expired in Shortly thereafter having lost its license royalty income Windsurfing International ceased operations br In Australian courts determined a patent case Windsurfing International Inc Anor v Petit Anor also part reported in IPR or NSWLR which attributed the first legally accepted use of a split boom to an Australian boy Richard Eastaugh Between the ages of ten and thirteen from to aided by his younger brothers he built around galvanized iron canoes and hill trolleys which he equipped with sails with split bamboo booms He sailed these in a sitting position and not as a windsurfer standing up near his home on the Swan River in Perth The judge noted that Mr Eastaugh greatly exaggerated the capacity of his galvanised iron canoes to sail to windward and that There is no corroboration of Mr Eastaugh s experiences by any other witness Neither of his brothers or his father was called br It is acknowledged in the courts that the separate Eastaugh Darby and Chilvers inventions pre dated the Schweitzer Drake patent br By the late s the sport was massive and in the midst of a full blown marketing and legal battle between the original market in the US and the exploding European markets This epic legal battle laid the ground for a still running rivalry between the European and American hemispheres br br br Trademarks br Windsurfing International briefly claimed trademark rights with respect to the word windsurfer While this was registered in the United States for some years it was not accepted for registration in many jurisdictions as the word was considered too descriptive Registration was ultimately lost in the United States for the same reason Eventually the sport became known widely as either sailboarding or windsurfing br br br Equipment br Windsurfers are often classified as either shortboards or longboards Longboards are usually longer than meters with a retractable daggerboard and are optimized for lighter winds or course racing Shortboards are less than meters long and are designed for planing conditions br While windsurfing is possible under a wide range of wind conditions most intermediate and advanced recreational windsurfers prefer to sail in conditions that allow for consistent planing with multi purpose not overly specialized free ride equipment Larger to liters free ride boards are capable of planing at wind speeds as low as kn m s if rigged with an adequate well tuned sail in the six to eight square meter range The pursuit of planing in lower winds has driven the popularity of wider and shorter boards with which planing is possible in wind as low as kn m s if sails in the to square meter range are used br Modern windsurfing boards can be classified into many categories The original Windsurfer board had a body made out of polyethylene filled with PVC foam Later hollow glass reinforced epoxy designs were used Most boards produced today have an expanded polystyrene foam core reinforced with a composite sandwich shell that can include carbon fiber kevlar or fiberglass in a matrix of epoxy and sometimes plywood and thermoplastics Racing and wave boards are usually very light to kg and are made out of carbon sandwich Such boards are very stiff and veneer is sometimes used to make them more shock resistant Boards aimed at the beginners are heavier to kg and more robust containing more fiberglass br br Beginner boards Sometimes called funboards these often have a daggerboard are almost as wide as Formula boards and have plenty of volume hence stability br Freeride Boards meant for comfortable recreational cruising mostly straight line sailing and occasional turning at planing speed aka blasting mainly in flat waters or in light to moderate swell They typically fall into the volume range of to liters The so called freeride sailing movement diverged from course racing as more recreational sailors chose to sail freely without being constrained to sailing on courses around buoys br Racing longboards Internationally recognised One Design Classes such as the WINDSURFER Class Mistral One Design or the old Olympic RS X class race boards and the new Olympic Class iQFoil br Formula Windsurfing Class Shorter boards up to one meter in width for use in Formula Windsurfing races See below for a more detailed description br Slalom boards In the past the key feature of slalom boards was merely speed but it has been proven that maneuverability and ease of use are as important as speed in order to get you around the slalom course faster and therefore modern slalom boards are shortboards aimed at top speed maneuverability and ease of use br Speed boards In essence an extremely narrow and sleek slalom board built for top speed only br Freestyle boards Related to wave boards in terms of maneuverability these are wider higher volume boards geared specifically at performing acrobatic tricks jumps rotations slides flips and loops on flat water Usually to liters in volume and about to centimeters in length with widths frequently in excess of centimeters Freestyle boards began to diverge more noticeably in design from wave boards in the early part of the decade as aerial tricks the Vulcan Spock Grubby Flaka and related New School maneuvers almost all involving a jump and spin component became the predominant part of the freestyle repertoire superseding Old School moves in which the board did not leave contact with the water br Wave boards Smaller lighter more maneuverable boards for use in breaking waves Characteristically sailors on wave boards perform high jumps while sailing against waves and they ride the face of a wave performing narrow linked turns bottom turns cutbacks and top turns in a similar way to surfing Wave boards usually have a volume between and liters with a length between and centimeters and to centimeters in width A general rule is for a sailor to use a wave board whose volume in liters is about the same as the sailor s weight in kilograms more volume providing additional flotation for sailing in light winds and less for high winds where less volume is needed to achieve planing In recent years the average width of wave boards has increased slightly as the length has shrunk while the range of volume has been maintained the same more or less according to board designers this makes wave boards easier to use under a wider range of conditions by sailors of differing abilities The most common sizes of sails used with wave boards are in the range of to square meters depending on the wind speed and the weight of the sailor br Sails br br Modern windsurfing sails are often made of monofilm clear polyester film dacron woven polyester and mylar Areas under high load may be reinforced with kevlar br Two designs of a sail are predominant camber induced and rotational Cambered sails have camber inducers plastic devices at the ends of battens which cup against the mast They help create a rigid aerofoil shape for faster speed and stability but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of battens br Beginners sails often do not have battens so they are lighter and easier to use in light winds However as the sailor improves a battened sail will provide greater stability in stronger winds br Rotational sails have battens which protrude beyond the back aspect of the mast They flip or rotate to the other side of the mast when tacking or jibing hence the rotation in the name Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the leeward side when powered but are nearly flat when sheeted out unpowered In comparison with cambered sails rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight but are easier to handle when maneuvering Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig br A windsurfing sail is tensioned at two points at the tack by downhaul and at the clew by outhaul There is a set of pulleys for downhauling at the tack and a grommet at the clew Most shape is given to the sail by applying a very strong downhaul which by design bends the mast The outhaul tension is relatively weak mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail s angle of attack br The sail is tuned by adjusting the downhaul and the outhaul tension Generally a sail is trimmed more flatter shape for stronger winds More downhaul tension loosens the upper part of the leech allowing the top of the sail to twist and spill wind during gusts shifting the center of effort strictly the center of pressure down Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up More outhaul lowers the camber draft making the sail flatter and easier to control but less powerful less outhaul results in more draft providing more low end power but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance br The disciplines of windsurfing wave freestyle freeride require different sails Wave sails are reinforced to survive the surf and are nearly flat when depowered to allow riding waves Freestyle sails are also flat when depowered and have high low end power to allow quick acceleration Freeride sails are all rounders that are comfortable to use and are meant for recreational windsurfing Race sails provide speed at the expense of qualities like comfort or maneuverability br The size of the sail is measured in square meters and can be from m to m for wave sails and m to m for race sails with ranges for freestyle and freeride sails spanning somewhere between these extremes Learning sails for children can be as small as m and race sails up to m br Associated Equipment br br Mast br Boom br Fin similar shape to a surfboard fin but is usually stronger for windsurfing br Universal joint elastic joints are more common but some are mechanical br Harness and Harness lines br Wet suit dry suit br Footwear br Helmet br Personal flotation device br Travel gear sail bags board bags car racks br Safety gear line distress strobe light whistle marine VHF radio br br br Technique br A sailboard is powered and controlled by the coordinated movements of the sail about its uni joint and of the sailor around the board This is achieved by balancing the weight of the sailor against the wind pressure in the sail while adjusting both factors relative to the board Learning this involves the development of reflexes and muscle memory similar to the process of learning to ride a bicycle These skills are typically and optimally done on large buoyant boards in light winds on flat water Depending on wind conditions and the skill or intentions of the rider at some point the sailboard will begin planing resulting in a rapid increase in speed This higher speed requires the learning of new skills as the apparent wind changes and the board becomes steerable like a surfboard br br br Learning and skill progression br Learning is a strenuous activity with many falls into the water climbs back onto the board and repeating The time taken to reach the point of significant enjoyment varies greatly br br br Youth br Windsurfing is suitable for children as young as with several board and sail brands producing Kids Rigs to accommodate these short and light weight windsurfers In some countries organisations exist to provide entry into the sport in a semi formal or club style environment i e The RYA s Team scheme Robert Robby Naish took up the fledgling sport of windsurfing at the age of and in won his first overall World Championship title at the age of br br br Light winds br The board moves through the water much like a sailing boat does using an extendable centreboard if available and fin or skeg for stability and lateral resistance The centreboard is retracted at broad points of sail again similarly to a sailing boat to allow for jibing control In these conditions windsurf boards also tack and jibe like a sailing boat br Directional control is achieved by moving the rig either forward turning away from the wind or aft turning towards the wind When jibing the clew of the sail is let around and allowed to rotate out and around the mast br Fall recovery The rider climbs onto the board grabs the pulling rope uphaul makes sure the mast foot is placed between his her two feet pulls the sail about one third out of the water lets the wind turn the sail board combination until he she has the wind right in the back pulls the sail all the way out places the mast hand hand closest to the mast on the boom pulls the mast over the center line of the board places the sail hand hand furthest from the mast on the boom then pulling on it to close the sail and power it br br br Strong winds br br In planing conditions a harness is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider s weight to counter the force in the sail As the wind increases the rider continues to sheet the sail the fin generates more lift and the board gains speed transitioning onto a plane The volume of board in the water displacement decreases and the rider moves rearward stepping into the footstraps for improved control When planing the board skims on the surface rather than displacing water as it moves Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider s weight sail and fin size wave conditions and rider ability With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around kn m s The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy but once planing water resistance decreases dramatically This means that it is possible to continue to plane although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone generating more lift at higher speeds and a centreboard is no longer used smaller boards do not have one A fin generates lift transferring a strong load to the board and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength A low pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin which can lead to cavitation leading to a sudden loss of lift called spin out equivalent to stalling in flight terminology Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is kn m s of wind but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport br Steering is mainly achieved by changing the center of lateral resistance located along the daggerboard or fin through rotating the sail either fore and aft Unlike fixed mast sail a boat windsurfing is rudderless and uses the universal joint to allow steering the board with the sail alone Jibing is done at full speed a so called carve jibe power jibe or planing jibe whereby the rider turns downwind by leaning the sail forward sheeting and applying pressure to the inside rail Leaning into the turn much like a snowboarder making a toe side turn Pressure is released from the sail as the board turns downwind allowing for the sail to be jibed Tacking is turning around going upwind and at higher speed has become an advanced maneuver requiring quick movements and good balance A heel side turn while planing called a cut back is usually only executed in wave riding br Water start In strong winds it is difficult to uphaul the sail pulling it out of the water while standing on the board so waterstarting is necessary This is done while water treading by positioning the mast perpendicular to the wind lifting the luff out of the water to allow the wind to catch the sail and then having the sail pull the sailor onto the board As the sail becomes powered it is then trimmed to bring the rider board and sail back onto a plane Occasionally a rider may be unable to waterstart if the wind has dropped If this happens the rider can wait for a gust and pump the sail to get back on the board If this becomes hopeless uphauling the sail will be necessary br br br Racers br br br Long board classes br br br

design change as often as every six months only with sponsorship is constant upgrading practical The steady constant of the one design is fun for recreation the introduction to competition that allows intermediate windsurfers to race on the same gear design as the best athletes from the Olympic Class These one design classes are the most social of all racing classes The most popular one design classes are the original WINDSURFER class the long running Mistral One Design the Youth development class Bic Techno and the rapidly expanding new iQFoil br br br Formula class br br Formula windsurfing has developed over the last years in order to facilitate high performance competition in light and moderate winds Formula is now a class of windsurfing boards controlled by World Sailing that has the principal characteristic of a maximum m width They have a single fin of maximum length cm and carry sails up to m Class rules allow sailors to choose boards produced by multiple manufacturers as long as they are certified as Formula boards and registered with ISAF and use fins and sails of different sizes With the sail fin and board choices the equipment is able to be tailored to suit sailors of all body shapes and formula windsurfing presents one of the fastest course racing sailing craft on the water Formula Windsurfing is popular in many locations around the globe with predominantly light winds and flat water br Large sails in combination with the wide style design allow planing in very low wind conditions as well as control and usability in high winds and bigger sea conditions Non planing sailing is very difficult with this design and racing is only conducted with a strict kn m s wind minimum in place Formula boards are used on flat water as opposed to coastal surf but racing is still held in windy conditions involving swell and chop In a Formula Windsurfing Grand Prix World Tour began with events in Europe and South America complementing the single event World Championships as a professional tour for the Formula class br Formula boards have excellent upwind and downwind ability but are not as comfortable on a beam reach unless fin sizes are reduced This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and downwind legs or just a simple upwind downwind return course br br br Raceboard class br Raceboards are longer windsurf boards with a daggerboard and movable mast rail allowing the sailor to be efficient on all points of sail Excellent upwind ability is combined with good reaching and even downwind ability typically sailed in an Olympic triangle course Whilst in decline in manufacture since the advent of shortboard course racing which evolved into Formula there remains some models in production and most notably the IMCO One Design remains popular amongst amateur racing clubs br br br Short board classes br br br Slalom br Slalom is a high speed race Typically there are two sorts of slalom courses br br Figure of eight All of the course should on a beam reach with two floating marks that have to be jibed around br Downwind More than two marks are laid and sailors sail a downwind course jibing around each mark only once br Slalom boards are small and narrow and require high winds Funboard class racing rules require winds of kn m s for the slalom event to take place br br br Ocean Slalom Marathon br There are major Ocean Slalom Marathons in the world The Defi Wind in France The Lancelin Ocean Classic in Western Australia and the Hatteras Marathon in the USA br br br Super X br This discipline is a cross between freestyle and slalom Competitors race on a short downwind slalom course must duck jibe on all turns and are required to perform several tricks along the way Competitors are required to wear protective equipment The Super X discipline was short lived and is now largely unpracticed it reached its peak in the early s br br br Speedsailing br Speedsailing takes place in several forms The International Speed Windsurfing Class ISWC organizes under the umbrella of World Sailing competitions in various locations around the world known for conditions suitable for good speeds The events are made up of heats sailed on a m course The average of each sailor s best speeds on the m course which is typically open for hours per heat is their speed for that heat As such it is possible for the sailor with the outright fastest time not to win the heat if his second best time pulls his average down Points are given for the placings in the heats and the overall event winner is the sailor with the best point score again not necessarily the fastest sailor Likewise points are given for places in the events and at the last event a World Speedsurfing Champion is crowned br On record attempts controlled by the World Sailing Speed Record Council WSSRC competitors complete timed runs on a m or nautical mile m course The current m record for Windsurfers is held by French

Zara Davis both set in Walvis Bay Namibia br With the advent of cheap and small GPS units and the website www gps speedsurfing com Speedsurfers have been able to organise impromptu competitions amongst themselves as well as more formal competitions such as the European Speed Meetings and Speedweeks fortnights in Australia With over sailors registered it is possible for windsurfers all over the world to compare speeds br br br Indoor br In indoor windsurfing was born with the Palais Omnisports de Paris Bercy making its spectacular debut It was during this first indoor event that Britain s Nik Baker from the south coast flourished and went on to add a whopping x Indoor World Championships to his name br Indoor windsurfing competitions are held especially in Europe during winter Powerful fans lined up along the side of a large pool propel the windsurfers Indoor competition disciplines include slalom style races and ramp jumping competitions It is extremely dangerous because the pool is barely one meter deep and is surrounded by concrete br World Champion Jessica Crisp has had arguably the worst injury in the history of the indoor events when during a warm up session jumping the ramp she snapped her leg and had to have emergency surgery in a French hospital This was at the height of her professional career and fame across Europe br The most famous indoor champions include Robert Teriitehau Jessica Crisp Robby Naish Nick Baker Eric Thieme and Nathalie LeLievre br br br Riders br br br Wavesailing br Wave sailing took off during the rapid development of windsurfing on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Maui It can be seen as comprising two distinct but related parts wave riding and wave jumping br A typical wave contest will score two jumps going out and two wave rides coming in A high scoring heat would consist of a double clean forward rotating jump a high one foot backward rotating jump a long wave ride with flowing bottom turns radical top turns a series of aerials and a aerial manoeuvre on the face of the waves such as a goiter taka wave planing forward or clean flowing back loop Depending on the conditions at the location some competitions will focus more on jumping while others focus more on the wave riding aspects br The most famous wave riding locations on earth include Ho okipa on the north shore of Maui Diamond Head on Oahu Klitm ller in Denmark Pozo and Tenerife in the Canary Islands Cabo Verde off the north west coast of Africa Moulay in Morocco Margaret River in Western Australia Pacasmayo in Peru Topocalma in Chile and Omaezaki in Japan br The World Cup Wavesailing competitions crown the professional world champions each year One of the most prestigious events in the windsurfing world is called The Aloha Classic at Ho okipa Beach on the north shore of Maui Hawaii br The Aloha Classic held at Ho okipa Beach Park on the north shore of Maui takes place each year in late October and early November for the best wind and wave conditions and it is common to have foot wave faces during the contest Since the event has been run by the International Windsurfing Tour IWT as the Grand Final of the IWT Wave Tour The IWT is the Hawaiian based organisation for the wave riders of the Asia Pacific hemisphere The Aloha Classic has often been the final event of the Professional Windsurfers Association PWA crowning the PWA Wave World Champions br br br br br Wave riding br Wave riding is a form of surfing with the extra speed and power afforded by the sail It is strongly connected to its roots in surfing in style and culture It involves the rider performing a series of bottom turns top turns and cutbacks whilst riding an unbroken wave back to the shore Top wave sailors are able to incorporate aerial moves into their wave riding and will use overhanging wave lips to launch themselves out in front of the wave in spectacular giant aerials br br br Wave jumping br Wave jumping involves stunts of varying levels of difficulty which are performed after the rider has jumped from the peak of an unbroken wave These are commonly referred to as aerial moves and include both forward rotation and backward rotations The rider and his equipment rotate doing single and double rotations and jumps where the sailor contorts his or her body and equipment Recent innovations have included combining moves whilst airborne and for the first time in one professional sailor Ricardo Campello has made attempts at a triple forward loop during a PWA competition br br br Big wave riding br At the most extreme end of the sport is big wave riding which means riders on waves faces over feet high The most popular place for this is on the north shore of Maui at place called Pe ahi to the local Hawaiians and known as JAWS to the rest of the world The biggest waves here can be up to foot faces It breaks only in the winter months from late October to March Other famous big wave locations include Nazar in Portugal Famous contemporary big wave riders include Kai Lenny Marcilio Browne Robby Swift Sarah Hauser Jason Polakow and Robby Naish The inaugural Big Wave Challenge annojunced the first ever winners in this category on April br br br Storm riding br The most famous storm riding event is known as The Red Bull Storm Chase It occurs only when there is a massive storm forecast with winds over knots and giant waves over feet It is an invitational event and is extremely dangerous The most recent winner was West Australian Jaeger Stone br br br Freestyle br Freestyle is a timed event which is judged The competitor who has the greatest repertoire or manages to complete most stunts wins Freestyle is about show and competitors are judged on their creativity Both the difficulty and the number of tricks make up the final score Sailors who perform tricks on both tacks port and starboard and perform the tricks fully planing score higher marks High scoring moves include Shifty Shaka Pushloop Double Air Culo Air Kabikuchi Air Skopu and double Power Moves for example Air Funnel Burner and Double Culo The latest freestyle windsurfing is well documented and gets constantly updated on Continentseven For novice windsurfers low wind freestyle tricks are an appropriate start such as sailing backwards with the fin out of the water or transitioning from a sailing stance to sitting on the board while continuing to sail br br br Big air br Competitors compete to see who can record the highest jump or maneuver A D accelerometer is worn to measure and record heights of the jumps Xensr
