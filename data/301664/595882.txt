id: 595882
A diver propulsion vehicle DPV also known as an underwater propulsion vehicle sea scooter underwater scooter or swimmer delivery vehicle SDV by armed forces is an item of diving equipment used by scuba divers to increase range underwater Range is restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed and the battery power of the DPV Time limits imposed on the diver by decompression requirements may also limit safe range in practice DPVs have recreational scientific and military applications br DPVs include a range of configurations from small easily portable scooter units with a small range and low speed to faired or enclosed units capable of carrying several divers longer distances at higher speeds br The earliest recorded DPVs were used for military purposes during World War II and were based on torpedo technology and components br br br Structure br A DPV usually consists of a pressure resistant watertight casing containing a battery powered electric motor which drives a propeller The design must ensure that the propeller cannot harm the diver diving equipment or marine life the vehicle cannot be accidentally started or run away from the diver and it remains approximately neutrally buoyant while in use underwater br br br Application br DPVs are useful for extending the range of an autonomous diver that is otherwise restricted by the amount of breathing gas that can be carried the rate at which that breathing gas is consumed which is increased by exertion and diver fatigue and the time limits imposed by decompression obligation which depend on the dive profile Typical uses include cave diving and technical diving where the vehicles help move bulky equipment and make better use of the limited underwater time imposed by the decompression requirements of deep diving Military applications include delivery of combat divers and their equipment over distances or at speeds that would be otherwise impracticable There are accessories that can be mounted to a DPV to make it more useful such as lights compasses and video cameras Use of a DPV on deep dives can reduce the risk of hypercapnia from overexertion and high breathing rate br br br Limitations br DPV operation requires greater situational awareness than simply swimming as some changes can happen much faster Operating a DPV requires simultaneous depth control buoyancy adjustment monitoring of breathing gas and navigation Buoyancy control is vital for diver safety The DPV has the capacity to dynamically compensate for poor buoyancy control by thrust vectoring while moving but on stopping the diver may turn out to be dangerously positively or negatively buoyant if adjustments were not made to suit the changes in depth while moving If the diver does not control the DPV properly a rapid ascent or descent under power can result in barotrauma or decompression sickness High speed travel in confined spaces or limited visibility can increase the risk of impact with the surroundings at speeds where injury and damage are more likely Many forms of smaller marine life are very well camouflaged or hide well and are only seen by divers who move very slowly and look carefully Fast movement and noise can frighten some fish into hiding or swimming away and the DPV is bulky and affects precise manoeuvring at close quarters The DPV occupies at least one hand while in use and may get in the way while performing precision work like macro photography Since the diver is not kicking for propulsion they will generally get colder due to lower physical activity and increased water flow This can be compensated by appropriate thermal insulation If the operation of the DPV is critical to exit from a long penetration dive it is necessary to allow for alternative propulsion in case of a breakdown to ensure safe exit before the breathing gas runs out Control of the DPV is additional task loading and can distract the diver from other matters A DPV can increase the risk of a silt out if the thrust is allowed to wash over the bottom br br br History br br Human torpedoes or manned torpedoes are a type of diver propulsion vehicle used as secret naval weapons in World War II The name was commonly used to refer to the weapons that Italy and later Britain deployed in the Mediterranean and used to attack ships in enemy harbours br The first human torpedo was the Italian Maiale Pig In operation it was carried by another vessel usually a normal submarine and launched near the target It was electrically propelled with two crewmen in diving suits and rebreathers riding astride They steered the torpedo at slow speed to the target used the detachable warhead as a limpet mine and then rode the torpedo away The nose of the torpedo was filled with pounds of TNT and would be hung under a ship s keel br The idea was successfully applied by the Italian navy Regia Marina early in World War II and then copied by the British when they discovered how effective this weapon could be after three Italian units successfully penetrated the harbour of Alexandria and damaged the British battleships HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Valiant and the tanker Sagona The official Italian name for their craft was Siluro a Lenta Corsa SLC or Slow running torpedo but the Italian operators nicknamed it Maiale after their inventor Teseo Tesei said that it was making the noise of a pig while moored on the beach The British versions were named chariots br br The Motorised Submersible Canoe MSC nicknamed Sleeping Beauty was built by British Special Operations Executive SOE during World War II as an underwater vehicle for a single frogman to perform clandestine reconnaissance or attacks against enemy vessels br br br Types br br br Diver tugs tow behind scooters br The most common type of DPV tows the diver who holds onto handles on the stern or bow Tow behind scooters are most efficient by placing the diver parallel to and above the propeller wash The diver wears a harness that includes a crotch strap with a D ring on the front of the strap The scooter is rigged with a tow leash that clips to the scooter with releasable metal snap br br br Swimmer delivery vehicles br br Swimmer Delivery Vehicles SDVs are wet subs designed to transport frogmen from a combat swimmer unit or naval Special Forces underwater over long distances SDVs carry a pilot co pilot navigator and combat swimmer team and their equipment to and from maritime mission objectives on land or at sea The pilot and co pilot are often a part of the swimmer team An example of a modern SDV in use today is the SEAL Delivery Vehicle used by the United States Navy SEALs and British Special Boat Service br For long range missions SDVs can carry their own onboard breathing gas supply to extend the range of the swimmer s scuba equipment br SDVs are typically used to land special operations forces or plant limpet mines on the hull of enemy ships In the former usage they can land a combat swimmer team covertly on a hostile shore in order to conduct missions on land After completing their mission the team may return to the SDV to exfiltrate back to the mother ship For extended missions on land a team can be re supplied by contact with other SDVs In the latter usage SDVs can stealthily plant mines and other bombs on ships or port infrastructure and then retreat to a safe distance before detonating the explosives In addition to destroying targets the SDV can mislead enemies as to where they are being attacked from One type of SDV the Mark SEAL Delivery Vehicle was also capable of firing torpedoes giving it the standoff ability to attack from up to nautical miles km away br The origins of the SDV stems from the Italian human torpedoes and the British Motorised Submersible Canoe used during World War II br br br Manned torpedoes br br These are torpedo or fish shaped vehicles for one or more divers typically sitting astride them or in hollows inside The human torpedo was used to great effect by commando frogmen in World War II who were able to sink more than tons worth of ships in the Mediterranean alone Similar vehicles have been made for work divers or sport divers but better streamlined as these do not have warheads the Dolphin made on the Isle of Wight UK in the s is an example Some Farallon and Aquazepp scooters are torpedo shaped with handles near the bow and a raised seat at the rear to support the diver s crotch against the slipstream br The Russian Protei and Proton carry the diver attached to the top The New Zealand made Proteus is strapped onto the diver s cylinder br br br Subskimmers br br The Subskimmer is a submersible rigid hulled inflatable boat RIB On the surface it is powered by a petrol engine when submerged the petrol engine is sealed and it runs on battery electric thrusters mounted on a steerable cross arm It can self inflate and deflate transforming itself from a fast light surface boat to a submerged DPV Started in the s by Submarine Products Ltd of Hexham Northumberland England Subskimmer is now a tradename owned by Marine Specialised Technology br br br Wet subs br br As DPVs get bigger they gradually merge into submarines A wet sub is a small submarine where the crew spaces are flooded at ambient pressure and the crew must wear diving gear Covert military operations use wet subs to deliver and retrieve operators into harbors and near shore undetected An example is the Multi Role Combatant Craft MRCC br br br Towed sleds br br These are unpowered boards usually rectangular towed by a surface boat which function as diving planes The diver holds onto the sled and may use a quick release tether to reduce fatigue Depth control while submerged is by adjusting the angle of attack Sometimes known as manta boards after the manta ray Towed sleds are useful for surveys and searches in good visibility in waters where there are not too many large obstacles The route is largely controlled by the towing vessel but the diver has a limited amount of control over vertical and lateral excursions br br br Modern DPVs br DPVs currently in
