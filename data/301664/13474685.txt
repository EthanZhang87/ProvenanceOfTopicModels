id: 13474685
A ground effect vehicle GEV also called a wing in ground effect WIG ground effect craft wingship flarecraft or ekranoplan Russian screenglider is a vehicle that is able to move over the surface by gaining support from the reactions of the air against the surface of the earth or water Typically it is designed to glide over a level surface usually over the sea by making use of ground effect the aerodynamic interaction between the moving wing and the surface below Some models can operate over any flat area such as frozen lakes or flat plains similar to a hovercraft br br br Design br br A ground effect vehicle needs some forward velocity to produce lift dynamically and the principal benefit of operating a wing in ground effect is to reduce its lift dependent drag The basic design principle is that the closer the wing operates to an external surface such as the ground when it is said to be in ground effect the less drag it experiences br An airfoil passing through air increases air pressure on the underside while decreasing pressure across the top The high and low pressures are maintained until they flow off the ends of the wings where they form vortices which in turn are the major cause of lift induced drag normally a significant portion of the drag affecting an aircraft The greater the span of a wing the less induced drag created for each unit of lift and the greater the efficiency of the particular wing This is the primary reason gliders have long wings br Placing the same wing near a surface such as the water or the ground has the same effect as increasing the aspect ratio because the ground prevents wingtip vortices from expanding but without having the complications associated with a long and slender wing so that the short stubs on a GEV can produce just as much lift as the much larger wing on a transport aircraft though it can do this only when close to the earth s surface Once sufficient speed has built up some GEVs may be capable of leaving ground effect and functioning as normal aircraft until they approach their destination The distinguishing characteristic is that they are unable to land or take off without a significant amount of help from the ground effect cushion and cannot climb until they have reached a much higher speed br A GEV is sometimes characterized as a transition between a hovercraft and an aircraft although this is not correct as a hovercraft is statically supported upon a cushion of pressurized air from an onboard downward directed fan Some GEV designs such as the Russian Lun and Dingo have used forced blowing under the wing by auxiliary engines to increase the high pressure area under the wing to assist the takeoff however they differ from hovercraft in still requiring forward motion to generate sufficient lift to fly br Although the GEV may look similar to the seaplane and share many technical characteristics it is generally not designed to fly out of ground effect It differs from the hovercraft in lacking low speed hover capability in much the same way that a fixed wing airplane differs from the helicopter Unlike the hydrofoil it does not have any contact with the surface of the water when in flight The ground effect vehicle constitutes a unique class of transportation br The Boston based United States company REGENT proposed an electric powered high wing design with a standard hull for water operations but also incorporated fore and aft mounted hydrofoil units designed to lift the craft out of the water during takeoff run to facilitate lower liftoff speeds br br br Wing configurations br br br Straight wing br Used by the Russian Rostislav Alexeyev for his ekranoplan The wings are significantly shorter than those of comparable aircraft and this configuration requires a high aft placed horizontal tail to maintain stability The pitch and altitude stability comes from the lift slope difference between a front low wing in ground effect commonly the main wing and an aft higher located second wing nearly out of ground effect generally named a stabilizer br br br Reverse delta wing br Developed by Alexander Lippisch this wing allows stable flight in ground effect through self stabilization This is the main Class B form of GEV br br br Tandem wings br Tandem wings can have three configurations br br A biplane style type utilising a shoulder mounted main lift wing and belly mounted sponsons similar to those on combat and transport helicopters br A canard style type with a mid size horizontal wing near the nose of the craft directing airflow under the main lift airfoil This type tandem design is a major improvement during takeoff as it creates an air cushion to lift the craft above the water at a lower speed thereby reducing water drag which is the biggest obstacle to successful seaplane launches br Two stubby wings as in the tandem airfoil flairboat produced by G nther J rg in Germany His particular design is self stabilizing longitudinally br br br Advantages and disadvantages br br Given similar hull size and power and depending on its specific design the lower lift induced drag of a GEV as compared to an aircraft of similar capacity will improve its fuel efficiency and up to a point its speed GEVs are also much faster than surface vessels of similar power because they avoid drag from the water br On the water the aircraft like construction of GEVs increases the risk of damage in collisions with surface objects Furthermore the limited number of egress points make it more difficult to evacuate the vehicle in an emergency br Since most GEVs are designed to operate from water accidents and engine failure typically are less hazardous than in a land based aircraft but the lack of altitude control leaves the pilot with fewer options for avoiding collision and to some extent that negates such benefits Low altitude brings high speed craft into conflict with ships buildings and rising land which may not be sufficiently visible in poor conditions to avoid GEVs may be unable to climb over or turn sharply enough to avoid collisions while drastic low level maneuvers risk contact with solid or water hazards beneath Aircraft can climb over most obstacles but GEVs are more limited br In high winds take off must be into the wind which takes the craft across successive lines of waves causing heavy pounding stressing the craft and creating an uncomfortable ride In light winds waves may be in any direction which can make control difficult as each wave causes the vehicle to both pitch and roll The lighter construction of GEVs makes their ability to operate in higher sea states less than that of conventional ships but greater than the ability of hovercraft or hydrofoils which are closer to the water surface br Like conventional aircraft greater power is needed for takeoff and like seaplanes ground effect vehicles must get on the step before they can accelerate to flight speed Careful design usually with multiple redesigns of hullforms is required to get this right which increases engineering costs This obstacle is more difficult for GEVs with short production runs to overcome For the vehicle to work its hull needs to be stable enough longitudinally to be controllable yet not so stable that it cannot lift off the water br The bottom of the vehicle must be formed to avoid excessive pressures on landing and taking off without sacrificing too much lateral stability and it must not create too much spray which damages the airframe and the engines The Russian ekranoplans show evidence of fixes for these problems in the form of multiple chines on the forward part of the hull undersides and in the forward location of the jet engines br Finally limited utility has kept production levels low enough that it has been impossible to amortize development costs sufficiently to make GEVs competitive with conventional aircraft br A study by students at NASA s Ames Research Center claims that use of GEVs for passenger travel could lead to cheaper flights increased accessibility and less pollution br br br Classification br One obstacle to GEV development is the classification and legislation to be applied The International Maritime Organization has studied the application of rules based on the International Code of Safety for High Speed Craft HSC code which was developed for fast ships such as hydrofoils hovercraft catamarans and the like The Russian Rules for classification and construction of small type A ekranoplans is a document upon which most GEV design is based However in the IMO classified the WISE or GEV under the category of ships br The International Maritime Organization recognizes three types of GEVs br br At the time of writing those classes only applied to craft carrying passengers or more and as of there was disagreement between national regulatory agencies about whether these vehicles should be classified and regulated as aircraft or as boats br br br History br br By the s the ground effect phenomenon was well known as pilots found that their airplanes appeared to become more efficient as they neared the runway surface during landing In the US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics issued Technical Memorandum Ground Effect on the Takeoff and Landing of Airplanes which was a translation into English of a summary of French research on the subject The French author Maurice Le Sueur had added a suggestion based on this phenomenon Here the imagination of inventors is offered a vast field The ground interference reduces the power required for level flight in large proportions so here is a means of rapid and at the same time economic locomotion Design an airplane which is always within the ground interference zone At first glance this apparatus is dangerous because the ground is uneven and the altitude called skimming permits no freedom of maneuver But on large sized aircraft over water the question may be attempted br By the s the technology started maturing in large part due to the independent contributions of Rostislav Alexeyev in the Soviet Union and German Alexander Lippisch working in the United States Alexeyev worked from his background as a ship designer whereas Lippisch worked as an aeronautical engineer The influence of Alexeyev and Lippisch remains noticeable in most GEVs seen today br br br Soviet Union br br Led by Alexeyev the Soviet Central Hydrofoil Design Bureau Russian was the center of ground effect craft development in the USSR The vehicle came to be known as an ekranoplan Russian screen plane from Russian literally screen effect or ground effect in English The military potential for such a craft was soon recognized and Alexeyev received support and financial resources from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev br Some manned and unmanned prototypes were built ranging up to eight tonnes in displacement This led to the development of a tonne military ekranoplan of m ft length The craft was dubbed the Caspian Sea Monster by U S intelligence experts after a huge unknown craft was spotted on satellite reconnaissance photos of the Caspian Sea area in the s With its short wings it looked airplane like in planform but would probably be incapable of flight Although it was designed to travel a maximum of m ft above the sea it was found to be most efficient at m ft reaching a top speed of knots km h in research flights br The Soviet ekranoplan program continued with the support of Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov It produced the most successful ekranoplan so far the tonne A Orlyonok These craft were originally developed as high speed military transports and were usually based on the shores of the Caspian Sea and Black Sea The Soviet Navy ordered Orlyonok class ekranoplans but this figure was later reduced to fewer than vessels with planned deployment mainly in the Black Sea and Baltic Sea fleets br A few Orlyonoks served with the Soviet Navy from to In the tonne Lun class ekranoplan was built as an anti ship missile launch platform A second Lun renamed Spasatel was laid down as a rescue vessel but was never finished The two major problems that the Soviet ekranoplans faced were poor longitudinal stability and a need for reliable navigation br Minister Ustinov died in and the new Minister of Defence Marshal Sokolov cancelled funding for the program Only three operational Orlyonok class ekranoplans with revised hull design and one Lun class ekranoplan remained at a naval base near Kaspiysk br Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union ekranoplans have been produced by the Volga Shipyard in Nizhniy Novgorod Smaller ekranoplans for non military use have been under development The CHDB had already developed the eight seat Volga in and Technologies and Transport is developing a smaller version called the Amphistar Beriev proposed a large craft of the type the Be as a flying ship cargo carrier but nothing came of the project br br br Germany br br br Lippisch Type and Hanno Fischer br br In Germany Lippisch was asked to build a very fast boat for American businessman Arthur A Collins In Lippisch developed the X a revolutionary design with reversed delta wing and T tail This design proved to be stable and efficient in ground effect and even though it was successfully tested Collins decided to stop the project and sold the patents to the German company Rhein Flugzeugbau RFB which further developed the inverse delta concept into the X and the six seat X These craft could be flown out of ground effect so that for example peninsulas could be overflown br Hanno Fischer took over the works from RFB and created his own company Fischer Flugmechanik which eventually completed two models The Airfisch carried two persons and the FS carried six persons The FS was to be developed by Fischer Flugmechanik for a Singapore Australian joint venture called Flightship Powered by a V Chevrolet automobile engine rated at kW the prototype made its first flight in February in the Netherlands The company no longer exists but the prototype craft was bought by Wigetworks a company based in Singapore and renamed as AirFish In that vehicle was registered as a ship in the Singapore Registry of Ships br The University of Duisburg Essen is supporting an ongoing research project to develop the Hoverwing br br br G nther J rg type tandem airfoil flairboat br br German engineer G nther J rg who had worked on Alexeyev s first designs and was familiar with the challenges of GEV design developed a GEV with two wings in a tandem arrangement the J rg II It was the third manned tandem airfoil boat named Skimmerfoil which was developed during his consultancy period in South Africa It was a simple and low cost design of a first seater tandem airfoil flairboat completely constructed of aluminium The prototype was in the SAAF Port Elizabeth Museum from July until and is now in private use Pictures of the museum show the boat after some years outside the museum and without protection against the sun br The consultancy of G nther J rg a specialist and insider of German airplane industry from and a colleague of Alexander Lippisch and Hanno Fischer was founded with a fundamental knowledge of wing in ground effect physics as well as results of fundamental tests under different conditions and designs having begun in For over years J rg built and tested different tandem airfoil flairboats in different sizes and made of different materials br The following tandem

the recreational and civilian ferry markets Germany Russia and the United States have provided most of the activity with some development in Australia China Japan Korea and Taiwan In these countries and regions small craft with up to ten seats have been built Other larger designs such as ferries and heavy transports have been proposed but have not been carried to completion br Besides the development of appropriate design and structural configuration automatic control and navigation systems have been developed These include altimeters with high accuracy for low altitude flight and lesser dependence on weather conditions Phase radio altimeters have become the choice for such applications beating laser altimeter isotropic or ultrasonic altimeters br With Russian consultation the
