This glossary of nautical terms is an alphabetical listing of terms and expressions connected with ships shipping seamanship and navigation on water mostly though not necessarily on the sea Some remain current while many date from the th to th centuries The word nautical derives from the Latin nauticus from Greek nautikos from naut s sailor from naus ship br Further information on nautical terminology may also be found at Nautical metaphors in English and additional military terms are listed in the Multiservice tactical brevity code article Terms used in other fields associated with bodies of water can be found at Glossary of fishery terms Glossary of underwater diving terminology Glossary of rowing terms and Glossary of meteorology br This glossary is split into two articles br

when tacking A sudden shift in the wind can also cause a square rigged vessel to be unintentionally caught aback with all sails aback This is a dangerous situation that risks serious damage In a fore
