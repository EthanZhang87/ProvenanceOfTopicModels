An unmanned surface vehicle unmanned surface vessel or uncrewed surface vessel USV colloquially called a drone boat drone ship or sea drone is a boat or ship that operates on the surface of the water without a crew USVs operate with various levels of autonomy from remote control to fully autonomous surface vehicles ASV br br br Regulatory environment br The regulatory environment for USV operations is changing rapidly as the technology develops and is more frequently deployed on commercial projects The Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship UK Industry Conduct Principles and Code of Practice V has been prepared by the UK Maritime Autonomous Systems Regulatory Working Group MASRWG and published by Maritime UK through the Society of Maritime Industries Organisations that contributed to the development of the MASS Code of Practice include The Maritime Coastguard Agency MCA Atlas Elektronik UK Ltd AutoNaut Fugro the UK Chamber of Shipping UKHO Trinity House Nautical Institute National Oceanography Centre Dynautics Limited SEA KIT International Sagar Defence Engineering and many more br By the end of Sagar Defence Engineering became the first company in India to build and supply USV to a Government organization br br br Development br As early as in World War I Germany designed and used remote controlled FL boats to attack British warships At the end of World War II remote controlled USVs were used by the US Navy for target drone and minesweeping applications In the twenty first century advances in USV control systems and navigation technologies have resulted in USVs that an operator can control remotely from land or a nearby vessel USVs that operate with partially autonomous control and USVs ASVs that operate fully autonomously Modern applications and research areas for USVs and ASVs include commercial shipping environmental and climate monitoring seafloor mapping passenger ferries robotic research surveillance inspection of bridges and other infrastructure military and naval operations br On January the Soleil succeeded in completing the first fully autonomous sea voyage by ship Built by MHI the demonstration was conducted in cooperation of Shin Nihonkai Ferry The seven hour kilometre voyage from Shinmoji in Northern Kyushu to the Iyonada Sea recorded a maximum speed of knots br In August the MV Mikage of the Mitsui O S K Lines sailed nautical miles over two days from Tsuruga to Sakai successfully completing the first crewless sea voyage to include docking of an autonomous coastal container ship in a two day trial br br br USV autonomy platforms br A number of autonomy platforms computer software tailored specifically for USV operations have been developed Some are tied to specific vessels while others are flexible and can be applied to different hull mechanical and electrical configurations br br br Computer controlled and operated USVs br The design and build of uncrewed surface vessels USVs is complex and challenging Hundreds of decisions relating to mission goals payload requirements power budget hull design communication systems and propulsion control and management need to be analysed and implemented Crewed vessel builders often rely on single source suppliers for propulsion and instrumentation to help the crew control the vessel In the case of an uncrewed or partially crewed vessel the builder needs to replace elements of the human interface with a remote human interface br br br Technical considerations br Uncrewed surface vessels vary in size from under metre LOA to metres with displacements ranging from a few kilograms to many tonnes so propulsion systems cover a wide range of power levels interfaces and technologies br Interface types broadly in order of size power br br PWM controlled Electronic Speed Controllers for simple electric motors br Serial bus using ASCII coded commands br Serial bus using binary protocols br Analogue interfaces found on many larger vessel br Proprietary CANbus protocols used by various engine manufacturers br Proprietary CANbus protocols used by manufacturers of generic engine controls br While many of these protocols carry demands to the propulsion most of them do not bring back any status information Feedback of achieved RPM may come from tacho pulses or from built in sensors that generate CAN or serial data Other sensors may be fitted such as current sensing on electric motors which can give an indication of power delivered Safety is a critical concern especially at high power levels but even a small propeller can cause damage or injury and the control system needs to be designed with this in mind This is particularly important in handover protocols for optionally manned boats br A frequent challenge faced in the control of USVs is the achievement of a smooth response from full astern to full ahead Crewed vessels usually have a detent behaviour with a wide deadband around the stop position To achieve accurate control of differential steering the control system needs to compensate for this deadband Internal combustion engines tend to drive through a gearbox with an inevitable sudden change when the gearbox engages which the control system must take into account Waterjets are the exception to this as they adjust smoothly through the zero point Electric drives often have a similar deadband built in so again the control system needs to be designed to preserve this behaviour for a man on board but smooth it out for automatic control e g for low speed manoeuvring and Dynamic Positioning br br br Oceanography hydrography and environmental monitoring br br USVs are valuable in oceanography as they are more maneuverable than moored or drifting weather buoys but far cheaper than the equivalent weather ships and research vessels and more flexible than commercial ship contributions USVs used in oceanographic research tend to be powered and propelled by renewable energy sources For example Wave gliders harness wave energy for primary propulsion whereas Saildrones use wind Other USVs harness solar energy to power electric motors Renewable powered and persistent ocean going USVs have solar cells to power their electronics Renewable powered USV persistence are typically measured in months br As late as early USVs had been predominantly used for environmental monitoring and hydrographic survey and future uptake was projected to be likely to grow in monitoring and surveillance of very remote locations due to their potential for multidisciplinary use Low operational cost has been a consistent driver for USV uptake when compared with crewed vessels Other drivers for USV uptake have changed through time including reducing risk to people spatio temporal efficiency endurance precision and accessing very shallow water br Non renewable powered USVs are a powerful tool for use in commercial hydrographic survey Using a small USV in parallel to traditional survey vessels as a force multiplier can double survey coverage and reduce time on site This method was used for a survey carried out in the Bering Sea off Alaska the ASV Global C Worker autonomous surface vehicle ASV collected nautical miles of survey of the project total This was a first for the survey industry and resulted in a saving of days at sea In the British USV Maxlimer completed an unmanned survey of square kilometres sq mi of seafloor in the Atlantic Ocean west of the English Channel br br br Saildrone br br A saildrone is a type of unmanned surface vehicle used primarily in oceans for data collection Saildrones are wind and solar powered and carry a suite of science sensors and navigational instruments They can follow a set of remotely prescribed waypoints The saildrone was invented by Richard Jenkins a British engineer founder and CEO of Saildrone Inc Saildrones have been used by scientists and research organizations like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA to survey the marine ecosystem fisheries and weather In January a small fleet of saildrones was launched to attempt the first autonomous circumnavigation of Antarctica One of the saildrones completed the mission traveling miles km over the seven month journey while collecting a detailed data set using on board environmental monitoring instrumentation br In August SD completed the fastest unmanned Atlantic crossing sailing from Bermuda to the UK and in October it completed the return trip to become the first autonomous vehicle to cross the Atlantic in both directions The University of Washington and the Saildrone company began a joint venture in called The Saildrone Pacific Sentinel Experiment which positioned six saildrones along the west coast of the United States to gather atmospheric and ocean data br Saildrone and NOAA deployed five modified hurricane class vessels at key locations in the Atlantic Ocean prior to the June start of the hurricane season In September SD was in location to obtain video and data from inside Hurricane Sam It was the first research vessel to ever venture into the middle of a major hurricane br br br Military applications br br The military usage of unmanned ships in the form of a Fire ship dates back to ancient times br USVs were used militarily as early as the s as remote controlled target craft following the development of the DCB s in World War One By World War II they were also being used for minesweeper purposes br Military applications for USVs include powered seaborne targets and minehunting as well as surveillance and reconnaissance strike operations and area denial or sea denial Various other applications are also being explored Some commercial USVs may utilize COLREGs compliant navigation br In DARPA launched an anti submarine USV prototype called Sea Hunter Turkish firm Aselsan produced ALBATROS T and ALBATROS K moving target boats for the Turkish Naval Forces to use in shooting drills Turkey s first indigenously developed armed USV AUSV is the ULAQ developed by Ares Shipyard Meteksan Defence Systems and Roketsan ULAQ is armed with Roketsan Cirit and UMTAS It completed its first firing test successfully on May The ULAQ can be deployed from combat ships It can be controlled remotely from mobile vehicles headquarters command centers and floating platforms It will serve in missions such as reconnaissance surveillance and intelligence surface warfare asymmetric warfare armed escort force protection and strategic facility security Ares Shipyard s CEO says that very different versions of ULAQ equipped with different weapons are under development Its primary user will be Turkish Naval Forces br In addition military applications for medium unmanned surface vessels MUSVs include fleet intelligence surveillance reconnaissance and electronic warfare In August L Harris Technologies was awarded a contract to build an MUSV prototype with options for up to nine vessels L Harris subcontracted Swiftships a Louisiana based shipbuilder to build the vessels with displacement of about tons The prototype is targeted for completion by end of It is the first unmanned naval platform programme in this class of ships which will likely play a major role in supporting the Distributed Maritime Operations strategy of the U S Navy Earlier Swiftships partnered with University of Louisiana in to build the Anaconda AN and later the Anaconda AN class of small USVs br On April the US sent unspecified unmanned coastal defense vessels to Ukraine amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine as part of a new security package br A theory was put forward by the BBC that an unmanned surface vehicle was used in the Crimean Bridge explosion After explosions at this bridge in July Russia s Anti Terrorist Committee claimed that Ukraine used unmanned surface vehicles to attack the bridge br In December Russia unveiled its first kamikaze USV called Oduvanchik It is reported that the sea drone can carry up to kg of explosives has a range of km and speed of km h br At a ceremony held on January TCB Marlin entered service in the Turkish Naval Forces as the first armed USV with the hull number TCB and name Marlin S DA br br br Possible first use in combat br During the Yemeni civil war on January an Al Madinah class frigate was attacked by Houthi forces the frigate was hit at the stern resulting in an explosion and a fire The crew was able to extinguish the fire but two members of the ship s crew were killed in the attack while three others were injured Houthi forces claimed to have targeted the ship with a missile but Saudi forces claim that the ship was hit by suicide boats br br br Further use in combat br br On October during the Russian invasion of Ukraine Ukrainian armed forces made a multi USV attack on Russian naval vessels at the Sevastopol Naval Base According to the Russian Defense Ministry seven USVs were involved in the attack with support of eight UAVs Naval News reported that little damage had occurred to either of the two warships that were hit by the small USVs a Russian frigate and a minesweeper However the military effect of the attack on the protected harbor of Sevastopol exceeded the direct damage because it led to the Russian Navy going into a protective mode essentially locking them in port New defenses were quickly added new procedures imposed and there was much less activity Russia s most powerful warships in the war were by mid November mostly tied up in port The US Naval Institute reported that by December the Russian Navy now knows it is vulnerable in its main naval base causing it to retreat further into its shell increasing defenses and reducing activity outside br A second USV attack occurred in mid November in Novorossiysk also in the Black Sea but much further from Russian occupied territory than Sevastopol br By January SpaceX restricted the licensing of its Starlink satellite internet communication technology to commercial use excluding direct military use on weapon systems The limitation restricted one use of the USV design used by Ukraine in late At the same time Russia increased its capabilities in small explosive USVs which had been used to ram a Ukrainian bridge on February By February the new Russian capability with USVs and the communication restrictions on the previous Ukrainian USVs could affect the balance in the naval war In the view of Naval News The Black Sea appears to be becoming more Russian friendly again The potential for wider use of USVs to impact the outcome of the conflict is not settled however as both physical constraints on existing technology and emerging counter USV capabilities may render these vessels vulnerable br On August the Olenegorsky Gornyak a Ropucha class landing ship was seriously damaged in the Black Sea Novorossiysk naval base after it was struck by a Ukrainian Maritime Drone carrying kilograms of TNT It was pictured listing heavily to one side while being towed back to port Some service personnel were onboard at the time br On February the Tarantul III class missile corvette Ivanovets was sunk in the Donuzlav Bay after being attacked by Ukrainian USVs br On February the Tsezar Kunikov a Ropucha class landing ship was sunk off Alupka by Ukrainian HUR MO Group forces using MAGURA V USV br br br Countermeasures used in combat br The naval war in the Black Sea during the Russian war on Ukraine has seen a number of countermeasures tried against the threat of Ukrainian uncrewed drones br Due to the drone attack on the Sevastopol Naval Base in October Russian forces had deployed several early countermeasures They have trained dolphins to protect the Naval Base while using various booms or nets to stop further attacks A main early change by mid was the use of dazzle camouflage which according to Reuters is designed to disguise a ship s heading and speed at sea aims to confuse modern operators of suicide drones and satellites and prevent them from easily identifying important ships while gunfire from helicopters can be used to destroy Ukrainian drones during an attack br By December the Russian effort to counter Ukrainian USVs in the Black Sea had expanded to include br br formal dedicated anti drone helicopter aviation units have been formed in Crimea to engage attacking USVs with unguided rockets and machine guns using Mi Hip and Ka Helix helicopters More occasionally Sukhoi Su Flanker fighter jets have been used br electromagnetic noise countermeasures have been tried to jam communications of offensive USV drones br escort ships have been used for high value targets Russia has recently begun to escort high value weapon transport ships and tankers escorts are typically frigates or patrol ships The convoys have been targeted by USVs on several occasions with the escorts facing the brunt of the attacks br Russia has tested flying an FPV drone from a patrol boat into a fixed target Use in naval combat had not yet been reported by December br By January Russian countermeasures had become increasingly capable and the Ukrainian Navy indicated that some offensive USV tactics that were worked out in and will not work in and that this military reality was driving change on the Ukrainian side Ukraine is developing autonomous underwater vehicles AUVs to increase offensive capability against improved Russian USV defenses br br br Strategic studies br An emerging field of research examines whether the proliferation of unmanned surface vessels can impact crisis dynamics or intra war escalation An exploratory report on the subject from the Center for Naval Analyses suggests seven potential concerns for military competition including accidental deliberate and inadvertent escalation While recent scholarship has examined the impact of unmanned aerial systems on crisis management the empirical record for unmanned surface and subsurface systems is thinner since these technologies have not yet been widely employed According to an article published by Reuters these drones are manufactured at a cost of each They use two impact detonator taken from Russian bombs With a length of metres they have a camera to allow a human to operate them and use a water jet for propulsion with a maximum speed of kilometres per hour and an endurance of hours Given their relative low cost compared to missiles or bombs they can be deployed in a mass attack Their low profile also makes them harder to hit br br br Cargo br br In the future many unmanned cargo ships are expected to cross the waters In November the first autonomous cargo ship MV Yara Birkeland was launched in Norway The fully electric ship is expected to substantially reduce the need for truck journeys br br br Urban vessels and small scale logistics br In the world s first urban autonomous vessels Roboats were deployed in the canals of Amsterdam Netherlands The ships developed by three institutions could carry up to five people collect waste deliver goods monitor the environment and provide on demand infrastructure br br br Seaweed farming br
