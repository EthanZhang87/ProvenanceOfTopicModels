Shipwrecking is an event that causes a shipwreck such as a ship striking something that causes the ship to sink the stranding of a ship on rocks land or shoal poor maintenance resulting in a lack of seaworthiness or the destruction of a ship either intentionally or by violent weather br br br Causes br br Factors for the loss of a ship may include br br poor design or failure of the ship s equipment or hull pressure hull br instability due to poor design improperly stowed cargo cargo that shifts its position or the free surface effect br navigation errors and other human errors leading to collisions with another ship rocks an iceberg RMS Titanic etc or running aground Costa Concordia br bad weather and powerful or large waves or gale winds This often leads to capsizing also referred to as foundering br warfare piracy mutiny or sabotage including guns torpedoes depth charges mines bombs and missiles br fire br biofouling such as accumulation of polychaete and other tube worms on wood hulls br overloading either cargo or icing and displacement exceeding the plimsoll line br intentional sinking scuttling br to form an artificial reef br for wreck diving br use as a target ship for training or testing weapons br as a blockship to create an obstacle to close a harbour river etc against enemy ships br to prevent a ship from falling into an enemy s hands e g Admiral Graf Spee br to destroy a derelict ship that poses a menace to navigation br as part of an insurance scam br br br Design and equipment failure br The hallmark of a shipwreck due to poor design is the capsize of Swedish warship Wasa in Stockholm harbour She was too narrow had too little ballast and her lower cannon deck had too low free board for good seaworthiness Poor design allowed the ferry MS Herald of Free Enterprise to put to sea with open roll on roll off bow doors with tragic consequences br Failure or leaking of the hull is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of buoyancy or the free surface effect and the subsequent sinking of the vessel Even the hulls of large modern ships have cracked in heavy storms Leaks between the hull planks of wooden vessels are a particular problem br Equipment failure caused the shipwreck of cruiseferry Estonia in The stress of stormy seas on the hull and bow especially caused the bow visor to break off in turn tearing the watertight bow door open and letting seawater flow onto the car deck She capsized with tragic consequences Failure of pumps can lead to the loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire br Failure of the means of propulsion such as engines sails or rigging can lead to the loss of a ship When the ship s movement is determined only by currents or the wind and particularly by storms a common result is that the ship is unable to avoid natural hazards like rocks shallow water or tidal races Loss of propulsion or steering can inhibit a ship s ability to safely position itself in a storm even far from land Waves attacking a ship s side can overwhelm and sink it br br br Instability and foundering br Instability is caused by the centre of mass of the ship rising above the metacenter resulting in the ship tipping on its side or capsizing To remain buoyant the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel known as downflooding Clearly for the ship to float the normally submerged parts of the hull will be watertight but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments including the engine room for crew access and to load and unload cargo In a capsize water can enter these openings if not watertight If a ship sinks after capsizing or as a consequence of a leak in the hull or other water ingress it may be described as having foundered or foundering Large ships are designed with compartments to help preserve the necessary buoyancy br br br Bad weather br br On October the tall ship Bounty a replica of the original HMS Bounty sank in a hurricane The vessel left New London Connecticut heading for St Petersburg Florida initially going on an easterly course to avoid Hurricane Sandy On October at EDT the ship s owner called the United States Coast Guard for help during the hurricane after losing contact with the ship s master He reported she was taking on water off the coast of North Carolina about miles km from the storm and the crew were preparing to abandon ship There were sixteen people aboard two of whom did not survive the sinking An inquiry into the sinking was held by the United States Coast Guard in Portsmouth Virginia from to February at which it was concluded that Captain Walbridge s decision to sail the ship into the path of Hurricane Sandy was the cause and the inquiry found this to have been a reckless decision br Poor weather can cause several problems br br high winds br low visibility br cold weather br high waves br Wind causes waves which result in other difficulties Waves make navigation difficult and dangerous near shallow water Also waves create buoyancy stresses on the structure of a hull The weight of breaking waves on the fabric of the ship force the crew to reduce speed or even travel in the same direction as the waves to prevent damage Also wind stresses the rigging of sailing ships br The force of the wind pushes ships in the direction of the wind Vessels with large windage suffer most Although powered ships are able to resist the force of the wind sailing vessels have few defences against strong wind When strong winds are imminent sailing vessels typically have several choices br br try to position themselves so that they cannot be blown into danger br shelter in a harbour br anchor preferably on the leeward side of a landform br Many losses of sailing ships were caused by sailing with a following wind so far into a bay that the ship became trapped upwind of a lee shore being unable to sail into the wind to leave the bay Low visibility caused by fog mist and heavy rain increase the navigator s problems Cold can cause metal to become brittle and fail more easily A build up of ice can cause instability by accumulating high on the ship or in severe cases crush the hull if the ship becomes trapped in a freezing sea br br br Rogue waves br According to one scientist who studies rogue waves two large ships sink every week on average but the cause is never studied to the same detail as an air crash It simply gets put down to bad weather Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence for their existence rogue waves are now proven to exist and known to be a natural ocean phenomenon Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damages inflicted on ships have long suggested they occurred however their scientific measurement was only positively confirmed following measurements of the Draupner wave a rogue wave at the Draupner platform in the North Sea on January with a maximum wave height of metres ft peak elevation of metres ft During that event minor damage was also inflicted on the platform far above sea level confirming that the reading was valid Their existence has also since been confirmed by satellite imagery of the ocean surface br br br Fire br Fire can cause the loss of ships in many ways The most obvious way would be the loss of a wooden ship which is burned until watertight integrity is compromised e g Cospatrick The detonation of cargo or ammunition can cause the breach of a steel hull An extreme temperature may compromise the durability properties of steel causing the hull to break on its own weight Often a large fire causes a ship to be abandoned and left to drift e g MS Achille Lauro Should it run aground beyond economic salvage it becomes a wreck br In extreme cases where the ship s cargo is either highly combustible such as oil natural gas or gasoline or explosive nitrates fertilizers ammunition a fire onboard may result in a catastrophic conflagration or explosion Such disasters may have catastrophic results especially if the disaster occurs in a harbour such as the Halifax Explosion br br br Navigation errors br br Many shipwrecks have occurred when the crew of the ship allowed the ship to collide with rocks reefs icebergs or other ships Collision has been one of the major causes of shipwreck Accurate navigation is made more difficult by poor visibility in bad weather Also many losses happened before modern navigation aids such as GPS radar and sonar were available Until the th century the most sophisticated navigational tools and techniques available dead reckoning using the magnetic compass marine chronometer to calculate longitude and ships logbook which recorded the vessel s heading and the speed measured by log or celestial navigation using marine chronometer and sextant were sufficiently accurate for journeys across oceans but these techniques and in many cases also the charts lacked the precision to avoid reefs close to shore br The Scilly naval disaster of which claimed nearly lives and was one of the greatest maritime disasters in the history of the British Isles is attributed to the mariner s inability to find their longitude This led to the Longitude Act to improve the aids available for navigation Marine chronometers were as revolutionary in the th century as GPS is today However the cost of these instruments could be prohibitive sometimes resulting in tragic consequences for ships that were still unable to determine their longitude as in the case of the Arniston br Even today when highly accurate navigational equipment is readily available and universally used there is still scope for error Using the incorrect horizontal datum for the chart of an area may mislead the navigator especially as many charts have not been updated to use modern data It is also important for the navigator to appreciate that charts may be significantly in error especially on less frequented coasts For example a recent revision of the map of South Georgia in the South Atlantic showed that previous maps were in some places in error by several kilometres br Over the centuries many technological and organizational developments have been used to reduce accidents at sea including br br International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea br Pilotage aids including lighthouses and sea marks br Basic navigation tools such as the magnetic compass nautical chart marine chronometer sextant log and sounding line br Advanced navigation tools such as radio communication radar navigation gyrocompass sonar hyperbolic Radio navigation and satellite navigation br Inspection of shipbuilding quality and maintenance of seaworthiness of the ship such as A at Lloyd s br Intelligence and better defences to protect the ship from acts of violence war and piracy br Use of fireproof nonflammable materials to prevent fires from spreading rapidly and modern fire fighting agents such as gases and foams that do not compromise the buoyancy and stability of the vessel as quickly as water br Built in devices to delay flooding long enough for rescue ships to retrieve survivors and or tow the ship to the nearest shipyard for repairs such as watertight compartments and pumps br br br See also br Flotsam and jetsam br List of shipwrecks br List of disasters
