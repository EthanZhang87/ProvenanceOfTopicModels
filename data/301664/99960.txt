A canoe is a lightweight narrow water vessel typically pointed at both ends and open on top propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel and using paddles br In British English the term canoe can also refer to a kayak whereas canoes are then called Canadian or open canoes to distinguish them from kayaks However for official competition purposes the American distinction between a kayak and a canoe is almost always adopted br br br Culture br Canoes were developed in cultures all over the world including some designed for use with sails or outriggers Until the mid th century the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade and in some places is still used as such sometimes with the addition of an outboard motor br Where the canoe played a key role in history such as the Northern United States Canada and New Zealand it remains an important theme in popular culture For instance the birch bark canoe of the largely birch based culture of the First Nations of Quebec Canada and North America provided these hunting peoples with the mobility essential to this way of life br Canoes are now widely used for competition indeed canoeing has been part of the Olympics since and pleasure such as racing whitewater touring and camping freestyle and general recreation br The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape length and construction material Although canoes were historically dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame construction materials later evolved to canvas on a wood frame then to aluminum Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass or those incorporating kevlar or graphite br br br History br br The word canoe came into English from the Spanish Portuguese word canoa which in turn was adopted from the Arawakan languages of the Caribbean for a dugout canoe kanawa br br br Dugouts br br Many peoples have made dugout canoes throughout history carving them out of a single piece of wood either a whole trunk or a slab of trunk from particularly large trees Dugout canoes go back to ancient times The Dufuna canoe discovered in Nigeria dates back to BC The Pesse canoe discovered in the Netherlands dates back to BC Excavations in Denmark reveal the use of dugouts and paddles during the Erteb lle period c c BC br Canoes played a vital role in the colonisation of the pre Columbian Caribbean as they were the only means of reaching the Caribbean Islands from mainland South America Around BC ancient Amerindian groups colonised the first Caribbean Islands using single hulled canoes Only a few pre Columbian Caribbean canoes have been found Several families of trees could have been used to construct Caribbean canoes including woods of the mahogany family Meliaceae such as the Cuban mahogany Swietenia mahagoni that can grow up to m tall and the red cedar Cedrela odorata that can grow up to m tall as well as the ceiba genus Malvacae such as Ceiba pentandra that can reach m in height It is likely that these canoes were built in a variety of sizes ranging from fishing canoes holding just one or a few people to larger ones able to carry as many as a few dozen and could have been used to reach the Caribbean Islands from the mainland Reports by historical chroniclers claim to have witnessed a canoe containing to Caribs when it came out to trade with a visiting English ship br There is still much dispute regarding the use of sails in Caribbean canoes Some archaeologists doubt that oceanic transportation would have been possible without the use of sails as winds and currents would have carried the canoes off course However no evidence of a sail or a Caribbean canoe that could have made use of a sail has been found Furthermore no historical sources mention Caribbean canoes with sails One possibility could be that canoes with sails were initially used in the Caribbean but later abandoned before European contact This however seems unlikely as long distance trade continued in the Caribbean even after the prehistoric colonisation of the islands Hence it is likely that early Caribbean colonists made use of canoes without sails br Native American groups of the north Pacific coast made dugout canoes in a number of styles for different purposes from western red cedar Thuja plicata or yellow cedar Chamaecyparis nootkatensis depending on availability Different styles were required for ocean going vessels versus river boats and for whale hunting versus seal hunting versus salmon fishing The Quinault of Washington State built shovel nose canoes with double bows for river travel that could slide over a logjam without needing to be portaged The Kootenai of the Canadian province of British Columbia made sturgeon nosed canoes from pine bark designed to be stable in windy conditions on Kootenay Lake br In recent years First Nations in British Columbia and Washington State have been revitalizing the ocean going canoe tradition Beginning in the s the Heiltsuk and Haida were early leaders in this movement The Paddle to Expo in Vancouver by the Heiltsuk and the Paddle to Seattle by multiple Native American tribes on the occasion of Washington State s centennial year were early instances of this In a large number of canoes paddled from up and down the coast to Bella Bella in its first canoe festival Qatuwas The revitalization continued and Tribal Journeys began with trips to various communities held in most years br Australian aboriginal people made canoes from hollowed out tree trunks as well as from tree bark The indigenous people of the Amazon commonly used Hymenaea Fabaceae trees br br br Bark canoes br br br Australia br Some Australian aboriginal peoples made bark canoes They could be made only from the bark of certain trees usually red gum or box gum and during summer After cutting the outline of the required size and shape a digging stick was used to cut through the bark to the hardwood and the bark was then slowly prised out using numerous smaller sticks The slab of bark was held in place by branches or handwoven rope and after separation from the tree lowered to the ground Small fires would then be lit on the inside of the bark to cause the bark to dry out and curl upwards after which the ends could be pulled together and stitched with hemp and plugged with mud It was then allowed to mature with frequent applications of grease and ochre The remaining tree was later dubbed a canoe tree by Europeans br Because of the porosity of the bark these bark canoes did not last too long about two years They were mainly used for fishing or crossing rivers and lakes to avoid long journeys They were usually propelled by punting with a long stick Another type of bark canoe was made out of a type of stringybark gum known as Messmate stringybark Eucalyptus obliqua pleating the bark and tying it at each end with a framework of cross ties and ribs This type was known as a pleated or tied bark canoe Bark strips could also be sewn together to make larger canoes known as sewn bark canoes br br br Americas br br Many indigenous peoples of the Americas built bark canoes They were usually skinned with birch bark over a light wooden frame but other types could be used if birch was scarce At a typical length of m ft and weight of kg lb the canoes were light enough to be portaged yet could carry a lot of cargo even in shallow water Although susceptible to damage from rocks they are easily repaired Their performance qualities were soon recognized by early European settler colonials and canoes played a key role in the exploration of North America with Samuel de Champlain canoeing as far as the Georgian Bay in br In a canoe was brought to Sir Robert Cecil s house in London and rowed on the Thames by Virginian Indians from Tsenacommacah In David Pietersz de Vries recorded a Mohawk canoe in Dutch possession at Rensselaerswyck capable of transporting bushels of maize Ren de Br hant de Galin e a French missionary who explored the Great Lakes in declared The convenience of these canoes is great in these waters full of cataracts or waterfalls and rapids through which it is impossible to take any boat When you reach them you load canoe and baggage upon your shoulders and go overland until the navigation is good and then you put your canoe back into the water and embark again American painter author and traveler George Catlin wrote that the bark canoe was the most beautiful and light model of all the water crafts that ever were invented br br The first explorer to cross the North American continent Alexander Mackenzie used canoes extensively as did David Thompson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition br In the North American fur trade the Hudson s Bay Company s voyageurs used three types of canoe br br The rabaska French canot du ma tre from the surname of Louise Le Ma tre an artisan in the Province of Quebec though the term would literally mean master canoe otherwise also referred to as the Montreal canoe was designed for the long haul from the St Lawrence River to western Lake Superior Its dimensions were length approximately m ft beam to m to ft and height about cm in It could carry packs weighing kg lb and kg lb of provisions With a crew of eight or ten paddling or rowing they could make three knots over calm waters Four to six men could portage it bottom up Henry Schoolcraft declared it altogether one of the most eligible modes of conveyance that can be employed upon the lakes Archibald McDonald of the Hudson s Bay Company wrote I never heard of such a canoe being wrecked or upset or swamped they swam like ducks br The canot du nord French canoe of the north a craft specially made and adapted for speedy travel was the workhorse of the fur trade transportation system About half the size of the rabaska it could carry about packs weighing kg lb and was manned by four to eight men It could in turn be carried by two men and was portaged in the upright position br The express canoe French canot l ger light canoe was about m ft long and was used to carry people reports and news br br The birch bark canoe was used in a kilometre mi supply route from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean and the Mackenzie River and continued to be used up to the end of the th century br The indigenous peoples of eastern Canada and the northeast United States made canoes using the bark of the paper birch which was harvested in early spring by stripping off the bark in one piece using wooden wedges Next the two ends stem and stern were sewn together and made watertight with the pitch of balsam fir The ribs of the canoe called verons in Canadian French were made of white cedar and the hull ribs and thwarts were fastened using watap a binding usually made from the roots of various species of conifers such as the white spruce black spruce or cedar and caulked with pitch br br br Skin canoes br Skin canoes are constructed using animal skins stretched over a framework Examples include the kayak and umiak br br br Modern canoes br br In th century North America the birch on frame construction technique evolved into the wood and canvas canoes made by fastening an external waterproofed canvas shell to planks and ribs by boat builders such as Old Town Canoe E M White Canoe Peterborough Canoe Company and at the Chestnut Canoe Company in New Brunswick Though similar to bark canoes in the use of ribs and a waterproof covering the construction method is different being built by bending ribs over a solid mold Once removed from the mold the decks thwarts and seats are installed and canvas is stretched tightly over the hull The canvas is then treated with a combination of varnishes and paints to render it more durable and watertight br Although canoes were once primarily a means of transport with industrialization they became popular as recreational or sporting watercraft John MacGregor popularized canoeing through his books founding the Royal Canoe Club in London in and the American Canoe Association in The Canadian Canoe Association was founded in and the British Canoe Union in br Sprint canoe was a demonstration sport at the Paris Olympics and became an Olympic discipline at the Berlin Olympics When the International Canoe Federation was formed in it became the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide br br br Hull design br br Hull design must meet different often conflicting requirements for speed carrying capacity maneuverability and stability The canoe s hull speed can be calculated using the principles of ship resistance and propulsion br br Length although this is often stated by manufacturers as the overall length of the boat what counts in performance terms is the length of the waterline and more specifically its value relative to the displacement the amount of water displaced by the boat of the canoe which is equal to the total weight of the boat and its contents because a floating body displaces its own weight in water When a canoe is paddled through water effort is required to push all the displaced water out of the way Canoes are displacement hulls the longer the waterline relative to its displacement the faster it can be paddled Among general touring canoeists m ft is a popular length providing a good compromise between capacity and cruising speed Too large a canoe will simply mean extra work paddling at cruising speed br Width beam a wider boat provides more stability at the expense of speed A canoe cuts through the water like a wedge and a shorter boat needs a narrower beam to reduce the angle of the wedge cutting through the water Canoe manufacturers typically provide three beam measurements the gunwale the measurement at the top of the hull the waterline the measurement at the point where the surface of the water meets the hull when it is empty and the widest point Another variation of the waterline beam measurement is called waterline where the displacement is taken into account This measurement is done at the waterline level when the maximum load is applied to the canoe Some canoe races use the waterline beam measurement as the standard for their regulations In races the measurement is done by measuring the widest point at cm from the bottom of the canoe br Freeboard a higher sided boat stays drier in rough water The disadvantage of high sides is extra weight extra wind resistance and increased susceptibility to cross winds br Stability and immersed bottom shape the hull can be optimized for initial stability the boat feels steady when it sits flat on the water or final stability resistance to rolling and capsizing A flatter bottomed hull has higher initial stability versus a rounder or V shaped hull in cross section has high final stability The fastest flat water non racing canoes have sharp V bottoms to cut through the water but they are difficult to turn and have a deeper draft which makes them less suitable for shallows Flat bottomed canoes are most popular among recreational canoeists At the cost of speed they have a shallow draft and more cargo space and they turn better The reason a flat bottom canoe has lower final stability is that the hull must wrap a sharper angle between the bottom and the sides compared to a more round bottomed boat br Keel an external keel makes a canoe track hold its course better and can stiffen a floppy bottom but it can get stuck on rocks and decrease stability in rapids br Profile the shape of the canoe s sides Sides that flare out above the waterline deflect water but require the paddler to reach out over the side of the canoe more Sides that do the reverse so that the gunwale width is less than the maximum width the canoe is said to have tumblehome br Rocker viewed from the side of the canoe rocker is the amount of curve in the hull in relation to the water much like the curve of a banana The full length of the hull is in the water so it tracks well and has good speed As rocker increases so does the ease of turning but at the cost of tracking Some Native American birch bark canoes were characterized by extreme rocker br Hull symmetry viewed from above a symmetrical hull has its widest point at the center of the hull and both ends are identical An asymmetrical hull typically has the widest section aft of centerline creating a longer bow and improving speed br br br Modern materials and construction br br br Plastic br Folding canoes usually consist of a PVC skin around an aluminum frame br Inflatable canoes contain no rigid frame members and can be deflated folded and stored in a bag The more durable types consist of an abrasion resistant nylon or rubber outer shell with separate PVC air chambers for the two side tubes and the floor br Royalex a composite material comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic ABS and an inner layer of ABS foam bonded by heat treatment was another plastic alternative for canoes until As a canoe material Royalex is lighter more resistant to UV damage and more rigid and has greater structural memory than non composite plastics such as polyethylene Canoes made of Royalex are however more expensive than canoes made from aluminum or from traditionally molded or roto molded polyethylene hulls Royalex is heavier and less suited for high performance paddling than fiber reinforced composites such as fiberglass kevlar or graphite Roto molded polyethylene is a cheaper alternative to Royalex br br br Fiber reinforced composites br Modern canoes are generally constructed by layering a fiber material inside a female mold Fiberglass is the most common material used in manufacturing canoes Fiberglass is not expensive can be molded to any shape and is easy to repair Kevlar is popular with paddlers looking for a light durable boat that will not be taken in whitewater Fiberglass and Kevlar are strong but lack rigidity Carbon fiber is used in racing canoes to create a very light rigid construction usually combined with Kevlar for durability Boats are built by draping the cloth in a mold then impregnating it with a liquid resin Optionally a vacuum process can be used to remove excess resin to reduce weight br A gel coat on the outside gives a smoother appearance br With stitch and glue plywood panels are stitched together to form a hull shape and the seams are reinforced with fiber reinforced composites and varnished br A cedar strip canoe is essentially a composite canoe with a cedar core Usually fiberglass is used to reinforce the canoe since it is clear and allows a view of the cedar br br br Aluminum br Before the invention of fiberglass aluminum was the standard choice for whitewater canoeing due to its value and strength by weight This material was once more popular but is being replaced by modern lighter materials It is tough durable and will take being dragged over the bottom very well as it has no gel or polymer outer coating which would make it subject to abrasion The hull does not degrade from long term exposure to sunlight and extremes of hot and cold do not affect the material It can dent is difficult to repair is noisy can get stuck on underwater objects and requires buoyancy chambers to assist in keeping the canoe afloat in a capsize br br br Canoes in culture br br In Canada the canoe has been a theme in history and folklore and is a symbol of Canadian identity From to the Canadian silver dollar depicted a canoe with the Northern Lights in the background br The Chasse galerie is a French Canadian tale of voyageurs who after a night of heavy drinking on New Year s Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some leagues about km away Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil Their canoe will fly through the air on condition that they not mention God s name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe One version of this fable ends with the coup de gr ce when still high in the sky the voyageurs complete the hazardous journey but the canoe overturns so the devil can honour the pact to deliver the voyageurs and still claim their souls br In John Steinbeck s novella The Pearl set in Mexico the main character s canoe is a means of making a living that has been passed down for generations and represents a link to cultural tradition br The M ori indigenous Polynesian people arrived in New Zealand in several waves of canoe called waka voyages Canoe traditions are important to the identity of M ori Whakapapa genealogical links back to the crew of founding canoes served to establish the origins of tribes and defined tribal boundaries and relationships br br br Types of canoes br Modern canoe types are usually categorized by the intended use Many modern canoe designs are hybrids a combination of two or more designs meant for multiple uses The purpose of the canoe will also often determine the materials used Most canoes are designed for either one person solo or two people tandem but some are designed for more than two people br br br Sprint br br Sprint canoe is also known as flatwater racing The paddler kneels on one knee and uses a single blade paddle Since canoes have no rudder they must be steered by the athlete s paddle using a J stroke Canoes may be entirely open or be partly covered The minimum length of the opening on a C is cm in Boats are long and streamlined with a narrow beam which makes them very unstable A C can be up to m ft long and weigh kg lb International Canoe Federation ICF classifications include C solo C crew of two and C crew of four Race distances at the Olympic Games were and meters br br br Slalom and wildwater br br In ICF whitewater slalom paddlers negotiate their way down m ft of whitewater rapids through a series of up to gates pairs of hanging poles The colour of the poles indicates the direction in which the paddlers must pass through time penalties are assessed for striking poles or missing gates Categories are C solo and C tandem the latter for two men and C M mixed for one woman and one man C boats must have a minimum weight and width of kg lb and m ft in and be not more than m ft long C s must have a minimum weight and width of kg lb and m ft in and be not more than m ft Rudders are prohibited Canoes are decked and propelled by single bladed paddles and the competitor must kneel br In ICF wildwater canoeing athletes paddle a course of class III to IV whitewater using the International Scale of River Difficulty passing over waves holes and rocks of a natural riverbed in events lasting either minutes Classic races or minutes Sprint races Categories are C and C for both women and men C s must have a minimum weight and width of kg lb and m ft in and a maximum length of m ft C s must have a minimum weight and width of kg lb and metres ft in and a maximum length of metres ft Rudders are prohibited The canoes are decked boats which must be propelled by single bladed paddles with the paddler kneeling inside br br br Marathon br br Marathons are long distance races which may include portages Under ICF rules minimum canoe weight is and kg and lb for C and C respectively Other rules can vary by race For example athletes in the Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie race in C s with a maximum length of m ft in minimum width of cm in at cm in from the bottom of the centre of the craft minimum height of cm in at the bow and cm in at the centre and stern The Texas Water Safari at km mi includes an open class the only rule being the vessel must be human powered Although novel setups have been tried the fastest so far has been the six man canoe br br br Touring br br A touring or tripping canoe is a boat for traveling on lakes and rivers with capacity for camping gear Tripping canoes such as the Chestnut Prospector and Old Town Tripper derivates are touring canoes for wilderness trips They are typically made of heavier and tougher materials and designed with the ability to carry large amounts of gear while being maneuverable enough for rivers with some whitewater Prospector is now a generic name for derivates of the Chestnut model a popular type of wilderness tripping canoe The Prospector is marked by a shallow arch hull with a relatively large amount of rocker giving optimal balance for wilderness tripping over lakes and rivers with some rapids br A touring canoe is sometimes covered with a greatly extended deck forming a cockpit for the paddlers A cockpit has the advantage that the gunwales can be made lower and narrower so the paddler can reach the water more easily br br br Freestyle br br A freestyle canoe is specialized for whitewater play and tricks Most are identical to short flat bottomed kayak playboats except for their internal outfitting The paddler kneels and uses a single blade canoe paddle Playboating is a discipline of whitewater canoeing where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place a playspot as opposed to downriver where the objective is to travel the length of a section of river although whitewater canoeists will often stop and play en route Specialized canoes known as playboats can be used br br br Square stern canoe br A square stern canoe is an asymmetrical canoe with a squared off stern for the mounting of an outboard motor and is meant for lake travel or fishing Since mounting a rudder on the square stern is very easy such canoes often are adapted for sailing br br br Canoe launches br A canoe launch is a place for launching canoes similar to a boat launch which is often for launching larger watercraft Canoe launches are frequently on river banks or beaches Canoe launches may be designated on maps of places such as parks or nature reserves br br br Photo gallery
