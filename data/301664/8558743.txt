A wet sub is a type of underwater vehicle either a submarine or a submersible that does not provide a dry environment for its occupants It is also described as an underwater vehicle where occupants are exposed to ambient environment during operations The watercraft is classified as medium sized or small vessel This type of submarine differs from other underwater personal transport devices by the fact that it has a hull around it and it is not a bare bones design br Usually scuba divers ride outside the device as one would ride a motorcycle or in a semi enclosed opening like a kayak or bobsled although it can be designed to fully enclose its occupant s to reduce drag An enclosed vehicle may also provide a dry viewing chamber for the occupant s The sub is generally propelled by an electric motor and is battery powered The depth and endurance is typically limited by the requirements of the divers particularly water temperature and breathable air br br br Military use br br Wet subs have been used to transport and deploy special operations forces in waters too shallow for an ordinary submarine lay mines particularly for attaching limpet mines directly to a ship firing torpedoes or gathering intelligence in harbors They have also been used to plant listening and recording devices on undersea cables in Operation Ivy Bells For military use the operator will sometimes use a rebreather device so as not to leave a trail of bubbles Military wet subs are deployed from a larger submarine or from a surface ship The SEAL Delivery Vehicle SDV used by the United States Navy SEALs and British Special Boat Service is an example that is in use today The SDV is used to insert Navy SEALs in shallow coastal waters or attack surface ships br br The Motorised Submersible Canoe developed by the British Special Operations Executive during World War II is another example br br br Hobbyists br br A wet sub is attractive to the amateur or small commercial builder since many of the problems associated with a dry sub are avoided as only the propulsion and power systems need to be waterproof and life support is much less of an issue than it is with a sealed occupant chamber Complete submarines of this type are also available commercially br Wet sub designs are often used for human powered submarines because they are smaller and lighter than dry submarines An example is the pedal operated wet sub called the Scubster which is powered by a twin propeller connected to the pedal belt br br br Research br br Every two years a human powered submarine race takes place at the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Bethesda Maryland br br br See also br Military wetsubs br br SEAL Delivery Vehicle br Human torpedo br Commercial wetsubs br br Necker Nymph br Diver propulsion vehicle br Scubster br Custom wetsubs br br Wet Nellie br br br br br br External links
