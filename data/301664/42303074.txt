An amphibious automobile is an automobile that is a means of transport viable on land as well as on or under water They are unarmored for civilian use br br br ATVs br br Amongst the smallest non air cushioned amphibious vehicles are amphibious ATVs all terrain vehicles These saw significant popularity in North America during the s and early s Typically an amphibious ATV AATV is a small lightweight off highway vehicle constructed from an integral hard plastic or fibreglass bodytub fitted with six sometimes eight driven wheels with low pressure balloon tires With no suspension other than what the tires offer and no steering wheels directional control is accomplished through skid steering just as on a tracked vehicle either by braking the wheels on the side where you want to turn or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side Most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines that will provide roughly mph or km h top speed on land br Constructed this way an AATV will float with ample freeboard and is capable of traversing swamps ponds and streams as well as dry land On land these units have high grip and great off road ability that can be further enhanced with an optional set of tracks that can be mounted directly onto the wheels Although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water albeit slowly outboard motors can be added for extended water use br In October Gibbs Amphibians introduced the Quadski the first amphibious vehicle capable of traveling mph or km h on land or water The Quadski was developed using Gibbs High Speed Amphibian technology which Gibbs originally developed for the Aquada an amphibious car which the company has still not produced because of regulatory issues br br br Cars br br Amphibious automobiles have been conceived from ca however the Second World War significantly stimulated their development Two of the most significant amphibious cars to date were developed during World War II The most proliferous was the German Schwimmwagen a small jeep like x vehicle designed by the Porsche engineering firm in and widely used in World War II The amphibious bodywork was designed by Erwin Komenda the firm s body construction designer using the engine and drive train of the K belwagen An amphibious version of the Willys MB jeep the Ford GPA or Seep short for Sea jeep was developed during World War II as well A specially modified GPA called Half Safe was driven and sailed around the world by Australian Ben Carlin in the s br One of the most capable post war amphibious off roaders was the German Amphi Ranger that featured a hull made of seawater resistant AlMg aluminium alloy Extensively engineered this costly vehicle was proven seaworthy at a Gale force storm off the North Sea coast Pohl Only about were built those who own one have found it capable of crossing the English Channel almost effortlessly br Purely recreational amphibian cars include the s Amphicar and the contemporary Gibbs Aquada With almost pieces built the Amphicar is still the most successfully produced civilian amphibious car to date The Gibbs Aquada stands out due to its capability of high speed planing on water Gibbs built fifty Aquadas in the early s after it was developed by a team assembled by founder Alan Gibbs before the company s engine supplier Rover was unable to continue providing engines Gibbs and new partner Neil Jenkins reconstituted the company and are now seeking U S regulatory approval for the Aquada Other amphibious cars include the US Hydra Spyder and the Spira u Not all were successful with the Herzog Conte Schwimmwagen failing to get past the prototype and into production br br br See also br Amphibious aircraft br Amphibious vehicle br Amphicar br Flying car br Unmanned aerial vehicle br Volkswagen Schwimmwagen br br br br br br External links br Media related to Amphibious cars at Wikimedia Commons br br FOMM Concept One
