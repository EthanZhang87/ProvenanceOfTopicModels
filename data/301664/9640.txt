An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one or more forms of energy into mechanical energy br Available energy sources include potential energy e g energy of the Earth s gravitational field as exploited in hydroelectric power generation heat energy e g geothermal chemical energy electric potential and nuclear energy from nuclear fission or nuclear fusion Many of these processes generate heat as an intermediate energy form so heat engines have special importance Some natural processes such as atmospheric convection cells convert environmental heat into motion e g in the form of rising air currents Mechanical energy is of particular importance in transportation but also plays a role in many industrial processes such as cutting grinding crushing and mixing br Mechanical heat engines convert heat into work via various thermodynamic processes The internal combustion engine is perhaps the most common example of a mechanical heat engine in which heat from the combustion of a fuel causes rapid pressurisation of the gaseous combustion products in the combustion chamber causing them to expand and drive a piston which turns a crankshaft Unlike internal combustion engines a reaction engine such as a jet engine produces thrust by expelling reaction mass in accordance with Newton s third law of motion br Apart from heat engines electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind up toys use elastic energy In biological systems molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create forces and ultimately motion a chemical engine but not a heat engine br Chemical heat engines which employ air ambient atmospheric gas as a part of the fuel reaction are regarded as airbreathing engines Chemical heat engines designed to operate outside of Earth s atmosphere e g rockets deeply submerged submarines need to carry an additional fuel component called the oxidizer although there exist super oxidizers suitable for use in rockets such as fluorine a more powerful oxidant than oxygen itself or the application needs to obtain heat by non chemical means such as by means of nuclear reactions br br br Emission Byproducts br All chemically fueled heat engines emit exhaust gases The cleanest engines emit water only Strict zero emissions generally means zero emissions other than water and water vapour Only heat engines which combust pure hydrogen fuel and pure oxygen oxidizer achieve zero emission by a strict definition in practice one type of rocket engine If hydrogen is burnt in combination with air all airbreathing engines a side reaction occurs between atmospheric oxygen and atmospheric nitrogen resulting in small emissions of NOx which is adverse even in small quantities If a hydrocarbon such as alcohol or gasoline is burnt as fuel large quantities of CO are emitted a potent greenhouse gas Hydrogen and oxygen from air can be reacted into water by a fuel cell without side production of NOx but this is an electrochemical engine not a heat engine br br br Terminology br The word engine derives from Old French engin from the Latin ingenium the root of the word ingenious Pre industrial weapons of war such as catapults trebuchets and battering rams were called siege engines and knowledge of how to construct them was often treated as a military secret The word gin as in cotton gin is short for engine Most mechanical devices invented during the industrial revolution were described as engines the steam engine being a notable example However the original steam engines such as those by Thomas Savery were not mechanical engines but pumps In this manner a fire engine in its original form was merely a water pump with the engine being transported to the fire by horses br In modern usage the term engine typically describes devices like steam engines and internal combustion engines that burn or otherwise consume fuel to perform mechanical work by exerting a torque or linear force usually in the form of thrust Devices converting heat energy into motion are commonly referred to simply as engines Examples of engines which exert a torque include the familiar automobile gasoline and diesel engines as well as turboshafts Examples of engines which produce thrust include turbofans and rockets br When the internal combustion engine was invented the term motor was initially used to distinguish it from the steam engine which was in wide use at the time powering locomotives and other vehicles such as steam rollers The term motor derives from the Latin verb moto which means to set in motion or maintain motion Thus a motor is a device that imparts motion br Motor and engine are interchangeable in standard English In some engineering jargons the two words have different meanings in which engine is a device that burns or otherwise consumes fuel changing its chemical composition and a motor is a device driven by electricity air or hydraulic pressure which does not change the chemical composition of its energy source However rocketry uses the term rocket motor even though they consume fuel br A heat engine may also serve as a prime mover a component that transforms the flow or changes in pressure of a fluid into mechanical energy An automobile powered by an internal combustion engine may make use of various motors and pumps but ultimately all such devices derive their power from the engine Another way of looking at it is that a motor receives power from an external source and then converts it into mechanical energy while an engine creates power from pressure derived directly from the explosive force of combustion or other chemical reaction or secondarily from the action of some such force on other substances such as air water or steam br br br History br br br Antiquity br Simple machines such as the club and oar examples of the lever are prehistoric More complex engines using human power animal power water power wind power and even steam power date back to antiquity Human power was focused by the use of simple engines such as the capstan windlass or treadmill and with ropes pulleys and block and tackle arrangements this power was transmitted usually with the forces multiplied and the speed reduced These were used in cranes and aboard ships in Ancient Greece as well as in mines water pumps and siege engines in Ancient Rome The writers of those times including Vitruvius Frontinus and Pliny the Elder treat these engines as commonplace so their invention may be more ancient By the st century AD cattle and horses were used in mills driving machines similar to those powered by humans in earlier times br According to Strabo a water powered mill was built in Kaberia of the kingdom of Mithridates during the st century BC Use of water wheels in mills spread throughout the Roman Empire over the next few centuries Some were quite complex with aqueducts dams and sluices to maintain and channel the water along with systems of gears or toothed wheels made of wood and metal to regulate the speed of rotation More sophisticated small devices such as the Antikythera Mechanism used complex trains of gears and dials to act as calendars or predict astronomical events In a poem by Ausonius in the th century AD he mentions a stone cutting saw powered by water Hero of Alexandria is credited with many such wind and steam powered machines in the st century AD including the Aeolipile and the vending machine often these machines were associated with worship such as animated altars and automated temple doors br br br Medieval br Medieval Muslim engineers employed gears in mills and water raising machines and used dams as a source of water power to provide additional power to watermills and water raising machines In the medieval Islamic world such advances made it possible to mechanize many industrial tasks previously carried out by manual labour br In al Jazari employed a crank conrod system for two of his water raising machines A rudimentary steam turbine device was described by Taqi al Din in and by Giovanni Branca in br In the th century the solid rocket motor was invented in China Driven by gunpowder this simplest form of internal combustion engine was unable to deliver sustained power but was useful for propelling weaponry at high speeds towards enemies in battle and for fireworks After invention this innovation spread throughout Europe br br br Industrial Revolution br br The Watt steam engine was the first type of steam engine to make use of steam at a pressure just above atmospheric to drive the piston helped by a partial vacuum Improving on the design of the Newcomen steam engine the Watt steam engine developed sporadically from to was a great step in the development of the steam engine Offering a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency James Watt s design became synonymous with steam engines due in no small part to his business partner Matthew Boulton It enabled rapid development of efficient semi automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where waterpower was not available Later development led to steam locomotives and great expansion of railway transportation br As for internal combustion piston engines these were tested in France in by de Rivaz and independently by the Ni pce brothers They were theoretically advanced by Carnot in In Eugenio Barsanti and Felice Matteucci invented and patented an engine using the free piston principle that was possibly the first cycle engine br The invention of an internal combustion engine which was later commercially successful was made during by Etienne Lenoir br In the Otto cycle was capable of giving a far higher power to weight ratio than steam engines and worked much better for many transportation applications such as cars and aircraft br br br Automobiles br The first commercially successful automobile created by Karl Benz added to the interest in light and powerful engines The lightweight gasoline internal combustion engine operating on a four stroke Otto cycle has been the most successful for light automobiles while the more efficient Diesel engine is used for trucks and buses However in recent years turbo Diesel engines have become increasingly popular especially outside of the United States even for quite small cars br br br Horizontally opposed pistons br In Karl Benz was granted a patent for his design of the first engine with horizontally opposed pistons His design created an engine in which the corresponding pistons move in horizontal cylinders and reach top dead center simultaneously thus automatically balancing each other with respect to their individual momentum Engines of this design are often referred to as flat engines because of their shape and lower profile They were used in the Volkswagen Beetle the Citro n CV some Porsche and Subaru cars many BMW and Honda motorcycles and propeller aircraft engines br br br Advancement br The continuing use of internal combustion engines in automobiles is partly due to the improvement of engine control systems onboard computers providing engine management processes and electronically controlled fuel injection Forced air induction by turbocharging and supercharging have increased power outputs and engine efficiencies Similar changes have been applied to smaller diesel engines giving them almost the same power characteristics as gasoline engines This is especially evident with the popularity of smaller diesel engine propelled cars in Europe Larger diesel engines are still often used in trucks and heavy machinery although they require special machining not available in most factories Diesel engines produce lower hydrocarbon and CO emissions but greater particulate and NOx pollution than gasoline engines Diesel engines are also more fuel efficient than comparable gasoline engines br br br Increasing power br In the first half of the th century a trend of increasing engine power occurred particularly in the U S models Design changes incorporated all known methods of increasing engine capacity including increasing the pressure in the cylinders to improve efficiency increasing the size of the engine and increasing the rate at which the engine produces work The higher forces and pressures created by these changes created engine vibration and size problems that led to stiffer more compact engines with V and opposed cylinder layouts replacing longer straight line arrangements br br br Combustion efficiency br Optimal combustion efficiency in passenger vehicles is reached with a coolant temperature of around C F br br br Engine configuration br Earlier automobile engine development produced a much larger range of engines than is in common use today Engines have ranged from to cylinder designs with corresponding differences in overall size weight engine displacement and cylinder bores Four cylinders and power ratings from to hp to kW were followed in a majority of the models Several three cylinder two stroke cycle models were built while most engines had straight or in line cylinders There were several V type models and horizontally opposed two and four cylinder makes too Overhead camshafts were frequently employed The smaller engines were commonly air cooled and located at the rear of the vehicle compression ratios were relatively low The s and s saw an increased interest in improved fuel economy which caused a return to smaller V and four cylinder layouts with as many as five valves per cylinder to improve efficiency The Bugatti Veyron operates with a W engine meaning that two V cylinder layouts are positioned next to each other to create the W shape sharing the same crankshaft br The largest internal combustion engine ever built is the W rtsil Sulzer RTA C a cylinder stroke turbocharged diesel engine that was designed to power the Emma M rsk the largest container ship in the world when launched in This engine has a mass of tonnes and when running at rpm Hz produces over MW and can use up to tonnes of fuel per day br br br Types br An engine can be put into a category according to two criteria the form of energy it accepts in order to create motion and the type of motion it outputs br br br Heat engine br br br Combustion engine br Combustion engines are heat engines driven by the heat of a combustion process br br br Internal combustion engine br br The internal combustion engine is an engine in which the combustion of a fuel generally fossil fuel occurs with an oxidizer usually air in a combustion chamber In an internal combustion engine the expansion of the high temperature and high pressure gases which are produced by the combustion directly applies force to components of the engine such as the pistons or turbine blades or a nozzle and by moving it over a distance generates mechanical work br br br External combustion engine br br An external combustion engine EC engine is a heat engine where an internal working fluid is heated by combustion of an external source through the engine wall or a heat exchanger The fluid then by expanding and acting on the mechanism of the engine produces motion and usable work The fluid is then cooled compressed and reused closed cycle or less commonly dumped and cool fluid pulled in open cycle air engine br Combustion refers to burning fuel with an oxidizer to supply the heat Engines of similar or even identical configuration and operation may use a supply of heat from other sources such as nuclear solar geothermal or exothermic reactions not involving combustion but are not then strictly classed as external combustion engines but as external thermal engines br The working fluid can be a gas as in a Stirling engine or steam as in a steam engine or an organic liquid such as n pentane in an Organic Rankine cycle The fluid can be of any composition gas is by far the most common although even single phase liquid is sometimes used In the case of the steam engine the fluid changes phases between liquid and gas br br br Air breathing combustion engines br Air breathing combustion engines are combustion engines that use the oxygen in atmospheric air to oxidise burn the fuel rather than carrying an oxidiser as in a rocket Theoretically this should result in a better specific impulse than for rocket engines br A continuous stream of air flows through the air breathing engine This air is compressed mixed with fuel ignited and expelled as the exhaust gas In reaction engines the majority of the combustion energy heat exits the engine as exhaust gas which provides thrust directly br br Examples br Typical air breathing engines include br br Reciprocating engine br Steam engine br Gas turbine br Airbreathing jet engine br Turbo propeller engine br Pulse detonation engine br Pulse jet br Ramjet br Scramjet br Liquid air cycle engine Reaction Engines SABRE br br br Environmental effects br The operation of engines typically has a negative impact upon air quality and ambient sound levels There has been a growing emphasis on the pollution producing features of automotive power systems This has created new interest in alternate power sources and internal combustion engine refinements Though a few limited production battery powered electric vehicles have appeared they have not proved competitive owing to costs and operating characteristics In the st century the diesel engine has been increasing in popularity with automobile owners However the gasoline engine and the Diesel engine with their new emission control devices to improve emission performance have not yet been significantly challenged A number of manufacturers have introduced hybrid engines mainly involving a small gasoline engine coupled with an electric motor and with a large battery bank these are starting to become a popular option because of their environment awareness br br br Air quality br Exhaust gas from a spark ignition engine consists of the following nitrogen to by volume water vapor to carbon dioxide to hydrogen to oxygen to carbon monoxide to unburnt hydrocarbons and partial oxidation products e g aldehydes to nitrogen monoxide to nitrous oxide ppm sulfur dioxide to ppm traces of other compounds such as fuel additives and lubricants also halogen and metallic compounds and other particles Carbon monoxide is highly toxic and can cause carbon monoxide poisoning so it is important to avoid any build up of the gas in a confined space Catalytic converters can reduce toxic emissions but not eliminate them Also resulting greenhouse gas emissions chiefly carbon dioxide from the widespread use of engines in the modern industrialized world is contributing to the global greenhouse effect a primary concern regarding global warming br br br Non combusting heat engines br br Some engines convert heat from noncombustive processes into mechanical work for example a nuclear power plant uses the heat from the nuclear reaction to produce steam and drive a steam engine or a gas turbine in a rocket engine may be driven by decomposing hydrogen peroxide Apart from the different energy source the engine is often engineered much the same as an internal or external combustion engine br Another group of noncombustive engines includes thermoacoustic heat engines sometimes called TA engines which are thermoacoustic devices that use high amplitude sound waves to pump heat from one place to another or conversely use a heat difference to induce high amplitude sound waves In general thermoacoustic engines can be divided into standing wave and travelling wave devices br Stirling engines can be another form of non combustive heat engine They use the Stirling thermodynamic cycle to convert heat into work An example is the alpha type Stirling engine whereby gas flows via a recuperator between a hot cylinder and a cold cylinder which are attached to reciprocating pistons out of phase The gas receives heat at the hot cylinder and expands driving the piston that turns the crankshaft After expanding and flowing through the recuperator the gas rejects heat at the cold cylinder and the ensuing pressure drop leads to its compression by the other displacement piston which forces it back to the hot cylinder br br br Non thermal chemically powered motor br Non thermal motors usually are powered by a chemical reaction but are not heat engines Examples include br br Molecular motor motors found in living things br Synthetic molecular motor br br br Electric motor br br An electric motor uses electrical energy to produce mechanical energy usually through the interaction of magnetic fields and current carrying conductors The reverse process producing electrical energy from mechanical energy is accomplished by a generator or dynamo Traction motors used on vehicles often perform both tasks Electric motors can be run as generators and vice versa although this is not always practical br Electric motors are ubiquitous being found in applications as diverse as industrial fans blowers and pumps machine tools household appliances power tools and disk drives They may be powered by direct current for example a battery powered portable device or motor vehicle or by alternating current from a central electrical distribution grid The smallest motors may be found in electric wristwatches Medium size motors of highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial uses The very largest electric motors are used for propulsion of large ships and for such purposes as pipeline compressors with ratings in the thousands of kilowatts Electric motors may be classified by the source of electric power by their internal construction and by their application br br The physical principle of production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field was known as early as Electric motors of increasing efficiency were constructed throughout the th century but commercial exploitation of electric motors on a large scale required efficient electrical generators and electrical distribution networks br To reduce the electric energy consumption from motors and their associated carbon footprints various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher efficiency electric motors A well designed motor can convert over of its input energy into useful power for decades When the efficiency of a motor is raised by even a few percentage points the savings in kilowatt hours and therefore in cost are enormous The electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial induction motor can be improved by reducing the electrical losses in the stator windings e g by increasing the cross sectional area of the conductor improving the winding technique and using materials with higher electrical conductivities such as copper reducing the electrical losses in the rotor coil or casting e g by using materials with higher electrical conductivities such as copper reducing magnetic losses by using better quality magnetic steel improving the aerodynamics of motors to reduce mechanical windage losses improving bearings to reduce friction losses and minimizing manufacturing tolerances For further discussion on this subject see Premium efficiency br By convention electric engine refers to a railroad electric locomotive rather than an electric motor br br br Physically powered motor br Some motors are powered by potential or kinetic energy for example some funiculars gravity plane and ropeway conveyors have used the energy from moving water or rocks and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases such as pneumatic motors springs clockwork motors and elastic bands br Historic military siege engines included large catapults trebuchets and to some extent battering rams were powered by potential energy br br br Pneumatic motor br br A pneumatic motor is a machine that converts potential energy in the form of compressed air into mechanical work Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor or piston air motor Pneumatic motors have found widespread success in the hand held tool industry and continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry However pneumatic motors must overcome efficiency deficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry br br br Hydraulic motor br br A hydraulic motor derives its power from a pressurized liquid This type of engine is used to move heavy loads and drive machinery br br br Hybrid br Some motor units can have multiple sources of energy For example a plug in hybrid electric vehicle s electric motor could source electricity from either a battery or from fossil fuels inputs via an internal combustion engine and a generator br br br Performance br The following are used in the assessment of the performance of an engine br br br Speed br Speed refers to crankshaft rotation in piston engines and the speed of compressor turbine rotors and electric motor rotors It is measured in revolutions per minute rpm br br br Thrust br Thrust is the force exerted on an airplane as a consequence of its propeller or jet engine accelerating the air passing through it It is also the force exerted on a ship as a consequence of its propeller accelerating the water passing through it br br br Torque br Torque is a turning moment on a shaft and is calculated by multiplying the force causing the moment by its distance from the shaft br br br Power br Power is the measure of how fast work is done br br br Efficiency br br Efficiency is a proportion of useful energy output compared to total input br br br Sound levels br Vehicle noise is predominantly from the engine at low vehicle speeds and from tires and the air flowing past the vehicle at higher speeds Electric motors are quieter than internal combustion engines Thrust producing engines such as turbofans turbojets and rockets emit the greatest amount of noise due to the way their thrust producing high velocity exhaust streams interact with the surrounding stationary air br Noise reduction technology includes intake and exhaust system mufflers silencers on gasoline and diesel engines and noise attenuation liners in turbofan inlets br br br Engines by use br Particularly notable kinds of
