Tonnage is a measure of the capacity of a ship and is commonly used to assess fees on commercial shipping The term derives from the taxation paid on tuns or casks of wine In modern maritime usage tonnage specifically refers to a calculation of the volume or cargo volume of a ship Although tonnage volume should not be confused with displacement the actual mass of the vessel the long ton or imperial ton of lb is derived from the fact that a tun of wine typically weighed that much br br br Current maritime units br Tonnage measurements are governed by an IMO Convention International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships London Rules which initially applied to all ships built after July and to older ships from July A commonly defined measurement system is important since a ship s registration fee harbour dues safety and manning rules and the like may be based on its gross tonnage GT or net tonnage NT br br br Gross tonnage br br Gross tonnage GT is a function of the volume of all of a ship s enclosed spaces from keel to funnel measured to the outside of the hull framing The numerical value for a ship s GT is always smaller than the numerical values of gross register tonnage GRT Gross tonnage is therefore a kind of capacity derived index that is used to rank a ship for purposes of determining manning safety and other statutory requirements and is expressed simply as GT which is a unitless entity even though it derives from the volumetric capacity in cubic metres br br br Net tonnage br br Net tonnage NT is based on a calculation of the volume of all cargo spaces of the ship It indicates a vessel s earning space and is a function of the moulded volume of all cargo spaces of the ship br br br Panama Canal UMS br br The Panama Canal Universal

was established by the International Commission of Constantinople in its Protocol of December It is still in use as amended by the Rules of Navigation of the Suez Canal Authority and is registered in the Suez Canal Tonnage Certificate br br br Thames measurement tonnage br br Thames measurement tonnage TM is another volumetric system generally used for small vessels such as yachts it uses a formula based on the vessel s length and beam br br br Historical maritime units br br br Traditional casks br br Historically in England tunnage was the medieval import duty on tuns of wine A tun was a large size of casks used for wine used in the wine trade The number of tuns that a ship could carry was used as a measure of the size of the ship br The wine trade to England originated in France which is where the tuns were made A French standard tun cask size was established about The th century Bordeaux wine tun was between and imperial gallons and L and US gal When measuring the tonnage of a ship the approximately cylindrical cask would have air space around it when stowed in a ship Therefore the volume of hold space required for several tuns was greater than the total of the capacity of those tuns imperial gallons is just over cubic feet m British practice by the th century was for a ton of cargo volume to be cubic feet m This is derived from an estimate of the hull space needed to fit the roughly cylindrical tun and is broadly consistent with the much earlier French definition given below br The Bordeaux tun was used as a measurement elsewhere in Europe By the th century multi decked ships which were loaded through hatchways as opposed to earlier undecked or single decked ships found it more convenient to use a smaller size of standard barrel This was the barrique bordelaise measuring a quarter of the size of the tun in English this barrel was termed a hogshead For instance Basque ships engaged in th century whaling in Labrador used this size of barrel with the name barrica The French tonneau de mer was legally defined in as the cubic space into which four barrique bordelaise fitted with the casks aligned two directly above the two below so not optimising the layout This redefined ton worked out as cubic pieds de roi cubic metres cu ft The difference between this measure and for instance the Spanish toneladas was calculated by recognised adjustment factors br br br Purpose of measuring tonnage br Tonnage measurement was important for an increasing number of reasons through history In England in the Middle Ages ships were often impressed by the crown for military use To do this in an efficient and speedy manner a measurement of size was needed The payment to the owner of the requisitioned ship was based on the tonnage Port dues and various licences were based on tonnage and it was a useful measure for a ship builder who needed to build a vessel that met the new owner s requirements br In the Tudor period a bounty per ton was paid for the construction of larger ships so the threshold for that payment had to be determined as well as the amount paid for those qualifying br br br Method of measuring br In the middle ages the normal way of discovering the tonnage of a ship was to load her with wine and see how many tuns could be fitted in There is an instance of the owner of a new ship in being challenged that his safe conduct was for a ton vessel whilst he had already loaded more than tons The excuse was accepted that he had no idea of her tonnage until she was loaded In another case in a dispute over the actual tonnage of a ship had to be resolved by having coopers part load her with presumably empty barrels to estimate what she could carry br The Tudor bounty paid for the construction of larger ship was apparently paid without any measurement system to confirm the actual size The presumption is that it was taken from the amount of cargo unloaded after the first voyage which would be recorded in the customs records of the relevant port br br br Gross register tonnage br br Gross register tonnage GRT represents the total internal volume of a vessel where one register ton is equal to a volume of cubic feet m a volume that if filled with fresh water would weigh around tonnes The definition and calculation of the internal volume is complex for instance a ship s hold may be assessed for bulk grain accounting for all the air space in the hold or for bales omitting the spaces into which bulk but not baled cargo would spill Gross register tonnage was replaced by gross tonnage in under the Tonnage

carry that is the gross register tonnage less the volume of spaces that do not hold cargo e g engine compartment helm station and crew spaces again with differences depending on which port or country does the calculations It represents the volume of the ship available for transporting freight or passengers It was replaced by net tonnage in under the Tonnage Measurement convention of br br br See
