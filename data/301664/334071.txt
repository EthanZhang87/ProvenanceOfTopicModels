A paddle steamer is a steamship or steamboat powered by a steam engine that drives paddle wheels to propel the craft through the water In antiquity paddle wheelers followed the development of poles oars and sails where the first uses were wheelers driven by animals or humans br br In the early th century paddle wheels were the predominant way of propulsion for steam powered boats In the late th century paddle propulsion was largely superseded by the screw propeller and other marine propulsion systems that have a higher efficiency especially in rough or open water Paddle wheels continue to be used by small pedal powered paddle boats and by some ships that operate tourist voyages The latter are often powered by diesel engines br br br Paddle wheels br br The paddle wheel is a large steel framework wheel The outer edge of the wheel is fitted with numerous regularly spaced paddle blades called floats or buckets The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels under water An engine rotates the paddle wheel in the water to produce thrust forward or backward as required More advanced paddle wheel designs feature feathering methods that keep each paddle blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing br br br Types of paddle steamers br br The three types of paddle wheel steamer are stern wheeler with a single wheel on the rear a side wheeler with one on each side and an inboard with the paddlewheel mounted in a recess amidship All were used as riverboats in the United States Some still operate for tourists for example on the Mississippi River br br br Stern wheeler br br Although the first stern wheelers were invented in Europe they saw the most service in North America especially on the Mississippi River Enterprise was built at Brownsville Pennsylvania in as an improvement over the less efficient side wheelers The second stern wheeler built Washington of had two decks and served as the prototype for all subsequent steamboats of the Mississippi including those made famous in Mark Twain s book Life on the Mississippi br br br Side wheeler br br Side wheelers are used as riverboats and as coastal craft Though the side wheels and enclosing sponsons make them wider than stern wheelers they may be more maneuverable since they can sometimes move the paddles at different speeds and even in opposite directions This extra maneuverability makes side wheelers popular on the narrower winding rivers of the Murray Darling system in Australia where a number still operate br European side wheelers such as PS Waverley connect the wheels with solid drive shafts that limit maneuverability and give the craft a wide turning radius Some were built with paddle clutches that disengage one or both paddles so they can turn independently However wisdom gained from early experience with side wheelers deemed that they be operated with clutches out or as solid shaft vessels Crews noticed that as ships approached the dock passengers moved to the side of the ship ready to disembark The shift in weight added to independent movements of the paddles could lead to imbalance and potential capsizing Paddle tugs were frequently operated with clutches in as the lack of passengers aboard meant that independent paddle movement could be used safely and the added maneuverability exploited to the full br br br Inboard paddlewheeler br Recessed or inboard paddlewheel boats were designed to ply narrow and snag infested backwaters By recessing the wheel within the hull it was protected somewhat from damage It was enclosed and could be spun at a high speed to provide acute maneuverability Most were built with inclined steam cylinders mounted on both sides of the paddleshaft and timed degrees apart like a locomotive making them instantly reversing br br br Feathering paddle wheel br br In a simple paddle wheel where the paddles are fixed around the periphery power is lost due to churning of the water as the paddles enter and leave the water surface Ideally the paddles should remain vertical while under water This ideal can be approximated by use of levers and linkages connected to a fixed eccentric The eccentric is fixed slightly forward of the main wheel centre It is coupled to each paddle by a rod and lever The geometry is designed such that the paddles are kept almost vertical for the short duration that they are in the water br br br History br br br Western world br br The use of a paddle wheel in navigation appears for the first time in the mechanical treatise of the Roman engineer Vitruvius De architectura X where he describes multigeared paddle wheels working as a ship odometer The first mention of paddle wheels as a means of propulsion comes from the fourth or fifth century military treatise De Rebus Bellicis chapter XVII where the anonymous Roman author describes an ox driven paddle wheel warship br br Animal power directed by the resources on ingenuity drives with ease and swiftness wherever utility summons it a warship suitable for naval combats which because of its enormous size human frailty as it were prevented from being operated by the hands of men In its hull or hollow interior oxen yoked in pairs to capstans turn wheels attached to the sides of the ship paddles projecting above the circumference or curved surface of the wheels beating the water with their strokes like oar blades as the wheels revolve work with an amazing and ingenious effect their action producing rapid motion This warship moreover because of its own bulk and because of the machinery working inside it joins battle with such pounding force that it easily wrecks and destroys all enemy warships coming at close quarters br br Italian physician Guido da Vigevano circa planning for a new crusade made illustrations for a paddle boat that was propelled by manually turned compound cranks br br One of the drawings of the Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddlewheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks The concept was improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in who devised a boat with five sets where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod an idea adopted by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio br In Spanish engineer Blasco de Garay received the support of Charles V to build ships equipped with manually powered side paddle wheels From to Garay built and launched five ships the most famous being the modified Portuguese carrack La Trinidad which surpassed a nearby galley in speed and maneuverability on June in the harbor of Barcelona The project however was discontinued th century writer Tom s Gonz lez claimed to have found proof that at least some of these vessels were steam powered but this theory was discredited by the Spanish authorities It has been proposed that Gonz lez mistook a steam powered desalinator created by Garay for a steam boiler br In Papin constructed a ship powered by hand cranked paddles An apocryphal story originating in by Louis Figuire held that this ship was steam powered rather than hand powered and that it was therefore the first steam powered vehicle of any kind The myth was refuted as early as by Ernst Gerland though still it finds credulous expression in some contemporary scholarly work br In Patrick Miller of Dalswinton invented a double hulled boat that was propelled on the Firth of Forth by men working a capstan that drove paddles on each side br br One of the first functioning steamships Palmip de which was also the first paddle steamer was built in France in by Marquis Claude de Jouffroy and his colleagues The m ft in steamer with rotating paddles sailed on the Doubs River in June and July In a new paddle steamer by de Jouffroy Pyroscaphe successfully steamed up the river Sa ne for minutes before the engine failed Bureaucracy and the French Revolution thwarted further progress by de Jouffroy br The next successful attempt at a paddle driven steam ship was by Scottish engineer William Symington who suggested steam power to Patrick Miller of Dalswinton Experimental boats built in and worked successfully on Lochmaben Loch In Symington built a barge hauler Charlotte Dundas for the Forth and Clyde Canal Company It successfully hauled two ton barges almost mi km in hours against a strong headwind on test in Enthusiasm was high but some directors of the company were concerned about the banks of the canal being damaged by the wash from a powered vessel and no more were ordered br While Charlotte Dundas was the first commercial paddle steamer and steamboat the first commercial success was possibly Robert Fulton s Clermont in New York which went into commercial service in between New York City and Albany Many other paddle equipped river boats followed all around the world the first in Europe being PS Comet designed by Henry Bell which started a scheduled passenger service on the River Clyde in br br In the first U S Mississippi River paddle steamer began operating out of New Orleans By Captain Henry Shreve had developed a steamboat suitable for local conditions Landings in New Orleans went from in to in and over in br The first stern wheeler was designed by Gerhard Moritz Roentgen from Rotterdam and used between Antwerp and Ghent in br Team boats paddle boats driven by horses were used for ferries the United States from the s s as they were economical and did not incur licensing costs imposed by the steam navigation monopoly In the s they were replaced by steamboats br After the American Civil War as the expanding railroads took many passengers the traffic became primarily bulk cargoes The largest and one of the last paddle steamers on the Mississippi was the sternwheeler Sprague Built in she pushed coal and petroleum until br In Europe from the s paddle steamers were used to take tourists from the rapidly expanding industrial cities on river cruises or to the newly established seaside resorts where pleasure piers were built to allow passengers to disembark regardless of the state of the tide Later these paddle steamers were fitted with luxurious saloons in an effort to compete with the facilities available on the railways Notable examples are the Thames steamers which took passengers from London to Southend on Sea and Margate Clyde steamers that connected Glasgow with the resort of Rothsay and the K ln D sseldorfer cruise steamers on the River Rhine Paddle steamer services continued into the mid th century when ownership of motor cars finally made them obsolete except for a few heritage examples br br br Asia br br br China br br The first mention of a paddle wheel ship from China is in the History of the Southern Dynasties compiled in the th century but describing the naval ships of the Liu Song dynasty used by admiral Wang Zhen e in his campaign against the Qiang in AD The ancient Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi had a paddle wheel ship built on the Xinting River south of Nanjing known as the thousand league boat When campaigning against Hou Jing in the Liang dynasty admiral Xu Shipu employed paddle wheel boats called water wheel boats At the siege of Liyang in the admiral Huang Faqiu employed foot treadle powered paddle wheel boats A successful paddle wheel warship design was made in China by Prince Li Gao in AD during an imperial examination of the provinces by the Tang dynasty emperor The Chinese Song dynasty issued the construction of many paddle wheel ships for its standing navy and according to the British biochemist historian and sinologist Joseph Needham br br between and AD a great number of treadmill operated paddle wheel craft large and small were built including sternwheelers and ships with as many as paddle wheels a side br br The standard Chinese term wheel ship was used by the Song period whereas a litany of colorful terms were used to describe it beforehand In the th century the Song government used paddle wheel ships en masse to defeat opposing armies of pirates armed with their own paddle wheel ships At the Battle of Caishi in paddle wheelers were also used with great success against the Jin dynasty navy The Chinese used the paddle wheel ship even during the First Opium War and for transport around the Pearl River during the early th century br br br Bangladesh br br Paddle steamers in Bangladesh were first operated by the River Steam Navigation Company Limited in Many steamers including the Garrow Florikan Burma Majabi Flamingo Kiyi Mohamend Sherpa Pathan Sandra Irani Seal Lali and Mekla dominated the southern rivers In Pakistan River Steamers inherited the fleet some of which were built at the private Garden Rich Dockyard in Kolkata br br After the liberation of Bangladesh there were around paddle steamers in nicknamed the Rockets for their speed operated by the newly founded Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation BIWTC These included PS Sandra PS Lali PS Mohammed PS Gazi PS Kiwi PS Ostrich PS Mahsud PS Lepcha and PS Tern The steamers served destinations such as Chandpur Barisal Khulna Morrelganj and Kolkata from Dhaka br In the s the steam engines were replaced with diesel ones and the wooden paddles were replaced with iron ones Hydraulic steering was introduced in the s followed by electro hydraulic systems in Modern equipment such as radar and GPS was also installed However PS Gazi PS Teal and PS Kiwi were decommissioned in the late s after catching fire while docked for repairs br Until four paddle steamers PS Ostrich built in Scotland in PS Mahsud PS Lepcha and PS Tern were operated by the BIWTC once a week This was a reduction from daily trips and commercial services were eventually stopped altogether due to safety concerns operational losses and a lack of passengers especially following the inauguration of the Padma Bridge br br br Seagoing paddle steamers br br The first seagoing trip of a paddle steamer was by the Albany in It steamed from the Hudson River along the coast to the Delaware River This was purely for the purpose of moving a river boat to a new market but paddle steamers began regular short coastal trips soon after In Pierre Andriel a French businessman bought in London the hp kW paddle steamer Margery later renamed Elise and made an eventful London Le Havre Paris crossing encountering heavy weather on the way He later operated his ship as a river packet on the Seine between Paris and Le Havre br The first paddle steamer to make a long ocean voyage crossing the Atlantic Ocean was SS Savannah built in expressly for this service Savannah set out for Liverpool on May sighting Ireland after days at sea This was the first powered crossing of the Atlantic although Savannah was built as a sailing ship with a steam auxiliary she also carried a full rig of sail for when winds were favorable being unable to complete the voyage under power alone In Charles Napier s Aaron Manby the world s first iron ship made the first direct steam crossing from London to Paris and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship br br In Sirius a fairly small steam packet built for the Cork to London route became the first vessel to cross the Atlantic under sustained steam power beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel s much larger Great Western by a day Great Western however was actually built for the transatlantic trade and so had sufficient coal for the passage Sirius had to burn furniture and other items after running out of coal Great Western s more successful crossing began the regular sailing of powered vessels across the Atlantic Beaver was the first coastal steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America Paddle steamers helped open Japan to the Western World in the mid th century br The largest paddle steamer ever built was Brunel s Great Eastern but it also had screw propulsion and sail rigging It was ft m long and weighed tons its paddlewheels being ft m in diameter br In oceangoing service paddle steamers became much less useful after the invention of the screw propeller but they remained in use in coastal service and as river tugboats thanks to their shallow draught and good maneuverability br The last crossing of the Atlantic by paddle steamer began on September the first leg of a journey to conclude six months and nine days later The steam paddle tug Eppleton Hall was never intended for oceangoing service but nevertheless was steamed from Newcastle to San Francisco As the voyage was intended to be completed under power the tug was rigged as steam propelled with a sail auxiliary The transatlantic stage of the voyage was completed exactly years after the voyage of Savannah br As of the PS Waverley is the last seagoing passenger carrying paddle steamer in the world br br br Paddle driven steam warships br br br Paddle frigates br br Beginning in the s the British Royal Navy began building paddle driven steam frigates and steam sloops By these had become obsolete due to the development of the propeller which was more efficient and less vulnerable to cannon fire One of the first screw driven warships HMS Rattler demonstrated her superiority over paddle steamers during numerous trials including one in where she pulled a paddle driven sister ship backwards in a tug of war However paddle warships were used extensively by the Russian Navy during the Crimean War of and by the United States Navy during the Mexican War of and the American Civil War of With the arrival of ironclad battleships from the late s the last remaining paddle frigates were decommissioned and sold into merchant navy service by the s These included Miami which became one of the first Boston steamers in br br br Paddle minesweepers br br At the start of the First World War the Royal Navy requisitioned more than fifty pleasure paddle steamers for use as auxiliary minesweepers The large spaces on their decks intended for promenading passengers proved to be ideal for handling the minesweeping booms and cables and the paddles allowed them to operate in coastal shallows and estuaries These were so successful that a new class of paddle ships the Racecourse class minesweepers were ordered and of them were built before the end of the war br In the Second World War some thirty pleasure paddle steamers were again requisitioned an added advantage was that their wooden hulls did not activate the new magnetic mines The paddle ships formed six minesweeping flotillas based at ports around the British coast Other paddle steamers were converted to anti aircraft ships More than twenty paddle steamers were used as emergency troop transports during the Dunkirk Evacuation in where they were able to get close inshore to embark directly from the beach One example was PS Medway Queen which saved an estimated men over the nine days of the evacuation and claimed to have shot down three German aircraft Another paddle minesweeper HMS Oriole was deliberately beached twice to allow soldiers to cross to other vessels using her as a jetty The paddle steamers between them were estimated to have rescued Allied troops during the operation for the loss of six of them br br br Modern paddle steamers br br br China br In order to thank the Qing government for its support of Japan in the Russo Japanese War Japan specially built a yacht called Yonghe Steamer for Cixi which from the outside should be a steam propelled structure with waterwheel like waterwheels on both sides to push the ship forward It can be viewed in the Summer Palace br br br US and Canada br br A few paddle steamers serve niche tourism needs as cruise boats on lakes and others such as Delta Queen still operate on the Mississippi River In Oregon several replica paddle steamers which are non steam powered sternwheelers built in the s and later are operated for tourism purposes on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers br br USS Wolverine built in as PS Seeandbee was the biggest passenger carrying paddle steamer ever built with a capacity for passengers it was converted to a training aircraft carrier during World War II PS Washington Irving also built in with a capacity for passengers operated on the Hudson River from until it was sunk in an accident in One of the
