A hydroplane or hydro or thunderboat is a fast motorboat where the hull shape is such that at speed the weight of the boat is supported by planing forces rather than simple buoyancy br A key aspect of hydroplanes is that they use the water they are on for lift rather than buoyancy as well as for propulsion and steering when travelling at high speed water is forced downwards by the bottom of the boat s hull The water therefore exerts an equal and opposite force upwards lifting the vast majority of the hull out of the water This process happening at the surface of the water is known as foiling br br br Hydroplane design br Early designs of the s were often built by amateurs who employed the lightest materials available to them at the time which were often glued timber boarding or plywood on the floor millimetre in plywood topsides and varnished canvas decks Most were about metres ft long and stepped hulls were employed with a millimetre in step to induce air under the hull to enable the boat to float on air bubbles The principle behind planing was not fully understood Thus hulls were flat bottomed with an upward curve at the bow and the step of the way aft The sheer weight of a hp engine was enough to keep the bow from digging in In Ireland the sport was managed by the Motor Yacht Club of Ireland which had a base at the Lough Ree Yacht Club near Athlone br One of the earliest examples can be seen in the May Popular Mechanics issue Mile A Minute Thrills of the Water tells the story of the No Vac by LeRoy F Malrose Sr aka Fred W McQuigg pen name Malrose was the lead design illustrator for Popular Mechanics magazine which at the time was located in Chicago The No Vac design and build actually began in when Malrose conceptualized an airfoil hull surface design which proved to produce far less drag than conventional V style boat hull designs of the time In June the No Vac was put to the test with professional racing driver Jimmy Rodgers at the helm That day the No Vac set the world water speed record for an outboard powered boat of miles per hour km h br The basic hull design of most hydroplanes has remained relatively unchanged since the s two sponsons in front one on each side of the bow behind the wide bow is a narrower mostly rectangular section housing the driver engine and steering equipment The aft part of the vessel is supported in the water by the lower half of the propeller which is designed to operate semi submerged at all times The goal is to keep as little of the boat in contact with the water as possible as water is much denser than air exerting more drag on the vehicle Essentially the boat flies over the surface of the water rather than actually traveling through it br One of the few significant attempts at a radically different design since the three point propriding design was introduced was referred to as Canard It reversed the width properties having a very narrow bow that only touched the water in one place and two small outrigger sponsons in the back br Early hydroplanes had mostly straight lines and flat surfaces aside from the uniformly curved bow and sponsons The curved bow was eventually replaced by what is known as a pickle fork bow where a space is left between the front few feet of the sponsons Also the centered single vertical tail similar to the ones on most modern airplanes was gradually replaced by a horizontal stabilizer supported by vertical tails on either side of the boat Later as fine tuning the hydrodynamics became more important the bottoms of the main hull have subtle curves to give the best lift br br br Unlimited hydroplane engines br The aviation industry has been the main source of engines for the boats For the first few decades after World War II they used surplus World War II era internal combustion airplane engines typically Rolls Royce Merlins or Griffons or Allison V s all liquid cooled V s The loud roar of these engines earned hydroplanes the nickname thunderboats or dinoboats br The Ted Jones designed Slo Mo Shun IV three point Allison powered hydroplane set the water speed record mph in Lake Washington off Seattle Washington s Sand Point on June breaking the previous ten plus year old record mph km h by almost mph km h Donald Campbell set seven world water speed records between and in the jet engine hydroplane Bluebird br Starting in they have increasingly used Vietnam War era turboshaft engines from helicopters in one hydroplane U used turbine engines in races to test the technology The most commonly used turbine is the Lycoming T used in the CH Chinook br Efforts have occasionally been made to use automotive engines but they generally have not proven competitive br The limited classes of inboard hydroplane racing are organized under the name Inboard Powerboat Circuit These classes utilize automotive power as well as two stroke power There are races throughout the country from April to October Many Unlimited drivers got their start in the limited classes br Prior to every official water speed record had been set by an American Briton Irishman or Canadian On November Australian Ken Warby piloted his Spirit of Australia purely on the jet thrust of its Westinghouse J turbojet to a velocity of km h mph to beat Lee Taylor s record Warby who had built the craft in his back yard used the publicity to find sponsorship to pay for improvements to the Spirit On October Warby travelled to Blowering Dam Australia and broke both the km h mph and km h mph barriers with an average speed of km h mph br As of Warby s record still stands and there have only been two official attempts to break it br br br See also br Hydrofoil a different concept also applying lift br Jetboat br Water speed record br br br br br br
