A yacht is a sailing or power vessel used for pleasure cruising or racing There is no standard definition though the term generally applies to vessels with a cabin intended for overnight use To be termed a yacht as opposed to a boat such a pleasure vessel is likely to be at least feet m in length and may have been judged to have good aesthetic qualities br The Commercial Yacht Code classifies yachts ft m and over as large Such yachts typically require a hired crew and have higher construction standards Further classifications for large yachts are commercial carrying no more than passengers private solely for the pleasure of the owner and guests or by flag the country under which it is registered A superyacht sometimes megayacht generally refers to any yacht sail or power longer than ft m br Racing yachts are designed to emphasize performance over comfort Charter yachts are run as a business for profit As of there were more than yachts of sufficient size to require a professional crew br br br Etymology br br The term yacht originates from the Dutch word jacht pl jachten which means hunt and originally referred to light fast sailing vessels that the Dutch Republic navy used to pursue pirates and other transgressors around and into the shallow waters of the Low Countries br br br History br The history of pleasure boats begins with rowed craft in Pharaonic Egyptian times and other vessels in the waters of Burma India Mindanao and Japan Anglo Saxon royal pleg scips play ships of the th century featured ornamented bows and sterns and had the capability of cooking on board br br br Sail br br The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of King James I of England While other monarchs used naval ships for transportation and conquest James I was the first English monarch to commission the construction of a yacht for his son Henry Prince of Wales in the early s Pleasure vessels acquired the name yacht after the time of Charles II who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands where a variety of jachten were already well developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the th century Upon his restoration to the English crown Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts which included at least one experimental catamaran The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in followed by the first open sailing competition in in English waters br Starting in England found itself in a series of wars a period that saw a decline in yachting In Ireland however the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbour Water Club in English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England s oldest yacht club in to support a fleet at Cumberland With maritime peace starting in came a resurgence of interest in yachting Boatbuilders who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government revenue cutters turned their skills again to yachts br The fast yachts of the early th century were fore and aft luggers schooners and sloops By the s yachts featured large sail areas a narrow beam and a deeper draft than was customary until then Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common with large wagers at stake The America s Cup arose out of a contest between the yacht America and its English competitors Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts the English by tonnage and the American by length br In the late th century yacht owners would base their choice of vessel upon preferred lifestyle and budget which would determine the size and type of vessel which would most likely be a fore and aft two masted sailing vessel A treatise on the subject A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing provided detailed information on selecting equipping sailing seamanship management of the paid crew and racing such vessels It included a brief section on steam yachts the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water br br br Power br br While sailing yachts continued to exist the development of reliable power plants created a new category of pleasure craft The power plants started with the steam engine and transitioned to the internal combustion engine Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel power yachts adopted the bridge in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility br br br Steam br The history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a steam auxiliary engine Early examples driven with paddle wheels had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck the origin of the bridge In the late th century steam engines became more efficient spars were removed and screw propellers became standard Steam yachts evolved with the development of the steam engine Ultimately engines employed pistons driven by steam within cylinders connected to a crank shaft which drove a propellor br Near the end of the th century compound engines came into widespread use Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures giving improved efficiency These stages were called expansions with double and triple expansion engines being common especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early th century when advances in the design of the steam turbine electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating piston steam engines br Large steam yachts were luxurious their staff included a captain engineer and stewards as well as deck hands br br br Internal combustion br Nicolaus Otto and Gottlieb Daimler developed practical four stroke gasoline engines starting in Beginning in engines increased in horsepower from horsepower kW to brake horsepower kW by Some were destined for speedboats other for motor yachts Diesel power plants for boats were demonstrated in Diesels became a more prevalent type of power plant in the th century thanks to their low cost of operation and reliability br br br Classification br br The Recreational Craft Directive requires that all vessels sold in the European Union and United Kingdom satisfy one of four design categories based on the wind force and seas that they are designed to encounter br br A yachts are fit for conditions that exceed wind force knots m s and foot m maximum wave heights encountered in ocean passages and extended voyages br B yachts are fit for conditions that are less than wind force knots m s and foot m maximum wave heights encountered in ocean passages and extended voyages br C yachts are fit for wind force knots m s and foot m maximum wave heights encountered in exposed coastal waters bays inlets lakes and rivers br D yachts are fit for wind force knots m s and foot m maximum wave heights encountered in sheltered coastal waters bays inlets lakes and rivers br The Large Commercial Yacht Code LY of Great Britain and its dominions defines a large yacht as one that is metres ft or more at the waterline and is in commercial use for sport or pleasure while not carrying cargo or more than passengers and carrying a professional crew The code regulates the equipping of such vessels both at sea and in port including such matters as crew duty times and the presence of a helicopter on board The code has different levels of standard for vessels above and below gross tons Such yachts may be considered superyachts and are more commonly at metres ft or more in length Other countries have standards similar to LY br Whereas commercial large yachts may carry no more than passengers private yachts are solely for the pleasure of the owner and guests do not carry the passenger restriction Yachts may be identified by flag the country under which a yacht is registered An industry publication categorizes superyachts by size by speed as explorer yachts as sailing yachts and classic yachts br br br Construction br Originally all yachts were made of wood using a wooden keel and ribs clad with planks These materials were supplanted with iron or steel in steam yachts In the s fiberglass became a prevalent material These materials and others continue in use Whereas yachts of feet m and below may be constructed of fiberglass larger yachts are more likely to be constructed of steel aluminum or composite fiber reinforced plastic br br Wood construction using conventional planks over ribs continues Hard chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique whereas yachts made with the WEST system plies of wood strips soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame provide a durable lightweight and robust hull br Metal hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to electrolysis Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world whereas aluminum is a much lighter material br Fiberglass construction is best suited for mass produced yachts using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving glass fabric and matting soaked in resin for the hull Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters below the waterline br br br Accommodations br br Depending on size a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins a main salon and a forward stateroom In smaller yachts the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers Typically the salon includes a dining area which may have a folding built in table The salon is typically contiguous to the galley A cruising yacht is likely to have a head bathroom with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank Larger yachts may have additional staterooms and heads There is typically a navigation station that allows planning the route br br br Systems br br Onboard systems include br br Electrical power provided by batteries recharged by a motor driven alternator sail or by a generator set motor br Water stored in on board tanks refilled on shore or replenished with a desalination water maker br Sanitation provided by toilets using seawater and discharged into holding tanks br Refrigeration by ice or an engine driven mechanical system br Modern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication measurement of surroundings and navigation br br Communications equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths specifically for maritime use br Instrumentation also provides information on depth of water under the vessel depth sounder windspeed anemometer and directional orientation compass br Navigation electronics include units that identify a vessel s location e g GPS and display the vessel s location chartplotter and other vessels and nearby shore radar br br br Sailing yachts br br Sailing yachts for cruising versus racing embody different tradeoffs between comfort and performance Cruising yachts emphasize comfort over performance Racing yachts are designed to compete against others in their class while providing adequate comfort to their crews br br br Cruising br Cruising yachts may be designed for near shore use or for passage making They may also be raced but they are designed and built with the comfort and amenities necessary for overnight voyages Qualities considered in cruising yachts include performance comfort under way ease of handling stability living comfort durability ease of maintenance affordability of ownership br br br Categories br Cruising sailboats share the common attribute of providing overnight accommodations They may be classified as small easy to haul behind a trailer near shore and off shore Multihull sailing yachts are a category apart br br Small yachts are typically shorter than feet m length overall Trailer sailers that are readily towed by a car are generally shorter than feet m length overall and weigh less than pounds kg br Near shore yachts typically range in size from feet m length overall br Offshore yachts typically exceed feet m length overall br br br Design br br Design considerations for a cruising yacht include seaworthiness performance sea kindliness and cost of construction as follows br br Seaworthiness addresses the integrity of the vessel and its ability to stay afloat and shelter its crew in the conditions encountered br Performance hinges on a number of factors including the waterline length longer means faster drag in the water narrower hull with smooth appendages hull shape and sail shape and area br Sea kindliness is an indicator of steering ease directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves br Multihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats compared with monohulls They may be catamarans or trimarans They rely on form stability having separate hulls far apart for their resistance to capsize Their advantages include greater stability speed for catamarans living space and shallower draft Their drawbacks include greater expenses greater windage more difficult tacking under sail less load capacity and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and for catamarans bridge deck configurations br br br Rigs br Gaff rigs have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats since the mid th century More common rigs are Bermuda fractional cutter and ketch Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the yawl schooner wishbone catboat br br br Gear br Sailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig running rigging to raise and adjust sails cleats to secure lines winches to work the sheets and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor A cruising yacht s deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor In temperate climates the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see through panels called a dodger Steering may be either by tiller or wheel br br br Engine br Cruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel except for the smallest cruising boats which may have an outboard gasoline motor A foot m sailboat might have a horsepower kW engine whereas a foot m sailboat might have a horsepower kW engine br br br Racing br br Racing yachts emphasize performance over comfort World Sailing recognizes eleven classes of racing yacht br br br Design features br High performance rigs provide aerodynamic efficiency and hydrodynamically efficient hulls minimize drag through the water and sideways motion br Racing yachts have a wide selection of weights and shapes of sail to accommodate different wind strengths and points of sail A suite of sails on a racing yachts would include several weights of jib and spinnaker plus a specialized storm jib and trysail in place of the mainsail Performance yachts are likely to have full battened kevlar or carbon fiber mainsails br Underwater foils can become more specialized starting with a higher aspect ratio fin keel with hydrodynamically efficient bulbs for ballast On some racing yachts a canting keel shifts angle from side to side to promote sailing with less heeling angle sideway tilt while other underwater foils take care of leeway sideways motion br br br Motor yachts br br Motor yachts range in length from feet m before they are considered super yachts or mega yachts which are feet m and longer They also vary by use by style and by hull type As of April a foot m yacht REV Ocean was under construction which when launched would replace the foot m Azzam as the longest superyacht As superyachts have grown size the distinction between a yacht and a ship perhaps converted for personal use has become unclear A proposed definition for calling a vessel a yacht rather than a ship would if it was constructed solely for personal use and has a combined occupancy of less than including crew br br br Classification br The United States Coast Guard classifies motorboats any vessel less than feet m propelled by machinery in four classes by length br br Class A motorboats less than feet m br Class motorboats feet m br Class motorboats feet m br Class motorboats feet m br br br Style br A motor yacht s style can both be functional and evoke an aesthetic trending towards the modern or the traditional Among the styles mentioned in the literature are br br Cruiser A cruiser has a displacement hull for economical long distance passage making br Sports cruiser A sports cruiser has a semi displacement or planing hull for fast trips br Sports fisherman A sports fisherman has a semi displacement or planing hull for fast trips and carries gear for recreational catching of large fish br Expedition An expedition yacht has a displacement hull for economical long distance passage making to remote destinations These are also called explorer yachts br Lobster A lobster yacht is styled like a Maine lobster boat and has a semi displacement or planing hull for fast trips br Trawler A trawler has conservative traditional styling and has a displacement hull for economical medium distance passage making br br br Hulls br There are three basic types of motor yacht hull full displacement semi displacement and planing which have progressively higher cruise speeds and hourly fuel consumption with increased engine power br br Full displacement hulls move the water up and out of the way of the vessel making a wave They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor depending on the units used Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed only the size of the waves produced br Semi displacement hulls allow speeds that are faster than the hull speed of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls br Planing hulls require sufficient power for the boat to slide up onto the surface which avoids the need to use power to lift water out of the way of the vessel Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides br A typical semi displacement yacht has a wedge shaped bow which promotes penetrating waves that transitions to flatter wider surfaces aft which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water the deep vee hull designed by Ray Hunt found in approximately of modern power boats br Cruising motor yachts are available in a range of styles as two engine catamarans ranging in length from feet m with top speeds ranging from knots km h br br br Engines br br Motor yachts typically have one or more diesel engines Gasoline powered motors and engines are the provenance of outboard motors and racing boats due to their power to weight ratios Two engines add expense but provide reliability and maneuverability over a single engine br Motor yachts in the foot m range might have the following hull horsepower cruise speed and hourly fuel consumption characteristics br br Full displacement hull two horsepower kW diesels to cruise at knots km h consuming US gallons per hour L h br Semi displacement hull two horsepower kW diesels to cruise at knots km h consuming US gallons per hour L h br Planing hull two horsepower kW diesels to cruise at knots km h consuming US gallons per hour L h br Superyachts may employ multiple horsepower kW diesels or a combination of diesels and gas turbines with a combined horsepower kW br br br See also br br br br br br External links
