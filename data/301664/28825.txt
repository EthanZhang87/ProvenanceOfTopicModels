id: 28825
A submarine or sub is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater It differs from a submersible which has more limited underwater capability The term is also sometimes used historically or colloquially to refer to remotely operated vehicles and robots as well as medium sized or smaller vessels such as the midget submarine and the wet sub Submarines are referred to as boats rather than ships irrespective of their size br Although experimental submarines had been built earlier submarine design took off during the th century and they were adopted by several navies They were first widely used during World War I and are now used in many navies large and small Military uses include attacking enemy surface ships merchant and military or other submarines and for aircraft carrier protection blockade running nuclear deterrence reconnaissance conventional land attack for example using a cruise missile and covert insertion of special forces Civilian uses include marine science salvage exploration and facility inspection and maintenance Submarines can be modified for specialized functions such as search and rescue missions and undersea cable repair They are used in tourism and undersea archaeology Modern deep diving submarines derive from the bathyscaphe which evolved from the diving bell br Most large submarines consist of a cylindrical body with hemispherical or conical ends and a vertical structure usually located amidships that houses communications and sensing devices as well as periscopes In modern submarines this structure is the sail in American usage and fin in European usage A conning tower was a feature of earlier designs a separate pressure hull above the main body of the boat that allowed the use of shorter periscopes There is a propeller or pump jet at the rear and various hydrodynamic control fins Smaller deep diving and specialty submarines may deviate significantly from this traditional design Submarines dive and resurface by means of diving planes and changing the amount of water and air in ballast tanks to affect their buoyancy br Submarines encompass a wide range of types and capabilities They include small autonomous examples such as one or two person subs that operate for a few hours to vessels that can remain submerged for six months such as the Russian Typhoon class the biggest submarines built Submarines can work at greater depths than are survivable or practical for human divers br br br History br br br Etymology br The word submarine means underwater or under sea as in submarine canyon submarine pipeline though as a noun it generally refers to a vessel that can travel underwater The term is a contraction of submarine boat and occurs as such in several languages e g French sous marin and Spanish submarino although others retain the original term such as Dutch Onderzeeboot German Unterseeboot Swedish Undervattensb t and Russian podvodnaya lodka all of which mean submarine boat By naval tradition submarines are usually referred to as boats rather than as ships regardless of their size Although referred to informally as boats U S submarines employ the designation USS United States Ship at the beginning of their names such as USS Alabama In the Royal Navy the designation HMS can refer to His Majesty s Ship or His Majesty s Submarine though the latter is sometimes rendered HMS m and submarines are generally referred to as boats rather than ships br br br Early human powered submersibles br br br th and th centuries br According to a report in Opusculum Taisnieri published in br br Two Greeks submerged and surfaced in the river Tagus near the City of Toledo several times in the presence of The Holy Roman Emperor Charles V without getting wet and with the flame they carried in their hands still alight br In the English mathematician William Bourne recorded in his book Inventions or Devises one of the first plans for an underwater navigation vehicle A few years later the Scottish mathematician and theologian John Napier wrote in his Secret Inventions that These inventions besides devises of sayling under water with divers other devises and strategems for harming of the enemyes by the Grace of God and worke of expert Craftsmen I hope to perform It is unclear whether he carried out his idea br Jer nimo de Ayanz y Beaumont created detailed designs for two types of air renovated submersible vehicles They were equipped with oars autonomous floating snorkels worked by inner pumps portholes and gloves used for the crew to manipulate underwater objects Ayanaz planned to use them for warfare using them to approach enemy ships undetected and set up timed gunpowder charges on their hulls br The first submersible of whose construction there exists reliable information was designed and built in by Cornelis Drebbel a Dutchman in the service of James I of England It was propelled by means of oars br br br th century br By the mid th century over a dozen patents for submarines submersible boats had been granted in England In Nathaniel Symons patented and built the first known working example of the use of a ballast tank for submersion His design used leather bags that could fill with water to submerge the craft A mechanism was used to twist the water out of the bags and cause the boat to resurface In the Gentlemen s Magazine reported that a similar design had initially been proposed by Giovanni Borelli in Further design improvement stagnated for over a century until application of new technologies for propulsion and stability br The first military submersible was Turtle a hand powered acorn shaped device designed by the American David Bushnell to accommodate a single person It was the first verified submarine capable of independent underwater operation and movement and the first to use screws for propulsion br br br th century br br In France built Nautilus a human powered submarine designed by American Robert Fulton They gave up on the experiment in as did the British when they reconsidered Fulton s submarine design br In Wilhelm Bauer s Brandtaucher was built in Germany It remains the oldest known surviving submarine in the world br In late in the American Civil War the Confederate navy s H L Hunley became the first military submarine to sink an enemy vessel the Union sloop of war USS Housatonic using a gun powder filled keg on a spar as a torpedo charge The Hunley also sank The explosion s shock waves may have killed its crew instantly preventing them from pumping the bilge or propelling the submarine br In Sub Marine Explorer was the first submarine to successfully dive cruise underwater and resurface under the crew s control The design by German American Julius H Kroehl in German Kr hl incorporated elements that are still used in modern submarines br In Flach was built at the Chilean government s request by Karl Flach a German engineer and immigrant It was the fifth submarine built in the world and along with a second submarine was intended to defend the port of Valparaiso against attack by the Spanish Navy during the Chincha Islands War br br br Mechanically powered submarines br Submarines could not be put into widespread or routine service use by navies until suitable engines were developed The era from to marked a pivotal time in submarine development and several important technologies appeared A number of nations built and used submarines Diesel electric propulsion became the dominant power system and equipment such as the periscope became standardized Countries conducted many experiments on effective tactics and weapons for submarines which led to their large impact in World War I br br br br br The first submarine not relying on human power for propulsion was the French Plongeur Diver launched in which used compressed air at kPa psi Narc s Monturiol designed the first air independent and combustion powered submarine Ict neo II which was launched in Barcelona Spain in br The submarine became a potentially viable weapon with the development of the Whitehead torpedo designed in by British engineer Robert Whitehead the first practical self propelled or locomotive torpedo The spar torpedo that had been developed earlier by the Confederate States Navy was considered to be impracticable as it was believed to have sunk both its intended target and H L Hunley the submarine that deployed it br The Irish inventor John Philip Holland built a model submarine in and in demonstrated the Holland I prototype This was followed by a number of unsuccessful designs In he designed the Holland Type VI submarine which used internal combustion engine power on the surface and electric battery power underwater Launched on May at Navy Lt Lewis Nixon s Crescent Shipyard in Elizabeth New Jersey Holland VI was purchased by the United States Navy on April becoming the Navy s first commissioned submarine christened USS Holland br Discussions between the English clergyman and inventor George Garrett and the Swedish industrialist Thorsten Nordenfelt led to the first practical steam powered submarines armed with torpedoes and ready for military use The first was Nordenfelt I a tonne metre ft vessel similar to Garrett s ill fated Resurgam with a range of kilometres nmi mi armed with a single torpedo in br br A reliable means of propulsion for the submerged vessel was only made possible in the s with the advent of the necessary electric battery technology The first electrically powered boats were built by Isaac Peral y Caballero in Spain who built Peral Dupuy de L me who built Gymnote and Gustave Z d who built Sir ne in France and James Franklin Waddington who built Porpoise in England Peral s design featured torpedoes and other systems that later became standard in submarines br br Commissioned in June the French steam and electric Narval employed the now typical double hull design with a pressure hull inside the outer shell These ton ships had a range of over km mi underwater The French submarine Aigrette in further improved the concept by using a diesel rather than a gasoline engine for surface power Large numbers of these submarines were built with seventy six completed before br The Royal Navy commissioned five Holland class submarines from Vickers Barrow in Furness under licence from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company from to Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on April Although the design had been purchased entirely from the US company the actual design used was an untested improvement to the original Holland design using a new horsepower kW petrol engine br These types of submarines were first used during the Russo Japanese War of Due to the blockade at Port Arthur the Russians sent their submarines to Vladivostok where by January there were seven boats enough to create the world s first operational submarine fleet The new submarine fleet began patrols on February usually lasting for about hours each The first confrontation with Japanese warships occurred on April when the Russian submarine Som was fired upon by Japanese torpedo boats but then withdrew br br br World War I br br Military submarines first made a significant impact in World War I Forces such as the U boats of Germany saw action in the First Battle of the Atlantic and were responsible for sinking RMS Lusitania which was sunk as a result of unrestricted submarine warfare and is often cited among the reasons for the entry of the United States into the war br At the outbreak of the war Germany had only twenty submarines available for combat although these included vessels of the diesel engined U class which had a sufficient range of miles km and speed of knots km h to allow them to operate effectively around the entire British coast By contrast the Royal Navy had a total of submarines though of mixed effectiveness In August a flotilla of ten U boats sailed from their base in Heligoland to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea in the first submarine war patrol in history br The U boats ability to function as practical war machines relied on new tactics their numbers and submarine technologies such as combination diesel electric power system developed in the preceding years More submersibles than true submarines U boats operated primarily on the surface using regular engines submerging occasionally to attack under battery power They were roughly triangular in cross section with a distinct keel to control rolling while surfaced and a distinct bow During World War I more than Allied ships were sunk by U boats br The British responded to the German developments in submarine technology with the creation of the K class submarines However these submarines were notoriously dangerous to operate due to their various design flaws and poor maneuverability br br br World War II br br During World War II Germany used submarines to devastating effect in the Battle of the Atlantic where it attempted to cut Britain s supply routes by sinking more merchant ships than Britain could replace These merchant ships were vital to supply Britain s population with food industry with raw material and armed forces with fuel and armaments Although the U boats had been updated in the interwar years the major innovation was improved communications encrypted using the Enigma cipher machine This allowed for mass attack naval tactics Rudeltaktik commonly known as wolfpack which ultimately ceased to be effective when the U boat s Enigma was cracked By the end of the war almost Allied ships warships merchantmen had been sunk by U boats Although successful early in the war Germany s U boat fleet suffered heavy casualties losing U boats and about submariners out of a casualty rate of about br The Imperial Japanese Navy operated the most varied fleet of submarines of any navy including Kaiten crewed torpedoes midget submarines Type A Ko hyoteki and Kairyu classes medium range submarines purpose built supply submarines and long range fleet submarines They also had submarines with the highest submerged speeds during World War II I class submarines and submarines that could carry multiple aircraft I class submarines They were also equipped with one of the most advanced torpedoes of the conflict the oxygen propelled Type Nevertheless despite their technical prowess Japan chose to use its submarines for fleet warfare and consequently were relatively unsuccessful as warships were fast maneuverable and well defended compared to merchant ships br The submarine force was the most effective anti ship weapon in the American arsenal Submarines though only about percent of the U S Navy destroyed over percent of the Japanese Navy including aircraft carriers battleship and cruisers US submarines also destroyed over percent of the Japanese merchant fleet crippling Japan s ability to supply its military forces and industrial war effort Allied submarines in the Pacific War destroyed more Japanese shipping than all other weapons combined This feat was considerably aided by the Imperial Japanese Navy s failure to provide adequate escort forces for the nation s merchant fleet br During World War II submarines served in the US Navy of which nearly were deployed to the Pacific When the Japanese attacked Hawaii in December boats were in commission submarines from the Gato Balao and Tench classes were commissioned during the war During the war US submarines were lost to all causes with directly due to hostilities US submarines sank enemy vessels a total tonnage of million tons of the total sunk br The Royal Navy Submarine Service was used primarily in the classic Axis blockade Its major operating areas were around Norway in the Mediterranean against the Axis supply routes to North Africa and in the Far East In that war British submarines sank million tons of enemy shipping and major warships the latter including submarines Among these is the only documented instance of a submarine sinking another submarine while both were submerged This occurred when HMS Venturer engaged U the Venturer crew manually computed a successful firing solution against a three dimensionally maneuvering target using techniques which became the basis of modern torpedo computer targeting systems Seventy four British submarines were lost the majority forty two in the Mediterranean br br br Cold War military models br br The first launch of a cruise missile SSM N Regulus from a submarine occurred in July from the deck of USS Tunny a World War II fleet boat modified to carry the missile with a nuclear warhead Tunny and its sister boat Barbero were the United States first nuclear deterrent patrol submarines In the s nuclear power partially replaced diesel electric propulsion Equipment was also developed to extract oxygen from sea water These two innovations gave submarines the ability to remain submerged for weeks or months Most of the naval submarines built since that time in the US the Soviet Union now Russia the UK and France have been powered by a nuclear reactor br In the first ballistic missile submarines were put into service by both the United States George Washington class and the Soviet Union Golf class as part of the Cold War nuclear deterrent strategy br During the Cold War the US and the Soviet Union maintained large submarine fleets that engaged in cat and mouse games The Soviet Union lost at least four submarines during this period K was lost in a part of which the CIA retrieved from the ocean floor with the Howard Hughes designed ship Glomar Explorer K in K in and Komsomolets in which held a depth record among military submarines m ft Many other Soviet subs such as K the first Soviet nuclear submarine and the first Soviet sub to reach the North Pole were badly damaged by fire or radiation leaks The US lost two nuclear submarines during this time USS Thresher due to equipment failure during a test dive while at its operational limit and USS Scorpion due to unknown causes br During the Indo Pakistani War of the Pakistan Navy s Hangor sank the Indian frigate INS Khukri This was the first sinking by a submarine since World War II During the same war Ghazi a Tench class submarine on loan to Pakistan from the US was sunk by the Indian Navy It was the first submarine combat loss since World War II In during the Falklands War the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was sunk by the British submarine HMS Conqueror the first sinking by a nuclear powered submarine in war Some weeks later on June during the Lebanon War an unnamed Israeli submarine torpedoed and sank the Lebanese coaster Transit which was carrying Palestinian refugees to Cyprus in the belief that the vessel was evacuating anti Israeli militias The ship was hit by two torpedoes managed to run aground but eventually sank There were dead including her captain The Israeli Navy disclosed the incident in November br br br Usage br br br Military br br Before and during World War II the primary role of the submarine was anti surface ship warfare Submarines would attack either on the surface using deck guns or submerged using torpedoes They were particularly effective in sinking Allied transatlantic shipping in both World Wars and in disrupting Japanese supply routes and naval operations in the Pacific in World War II br Mine laying submarines were developed in the early part of the th century The facility was used in both World Wars Submarines were also used for inserting and removing covert agents and military forces in special operations for intelligence gathering and to rescue aircrew during air attacks on islands where the airmen would be told of safe places to crash land so the submarines could rescue them Submarines could carry cargo through hostile waters or act as supply vessels for other submarines br Submarines could usually locate and attack other submarines only on the surface although HMS Venturer managed to sink U with a four torpedo spread while both were submerged The British developed a specialized anti submarine submarine in WWI the R class After WWII with the development of the homing torpedo better sonar systems and nuclear propulsion submarines also became able to hunt each other effectively br The development of submarine launched ballistic missile and submarine launched cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster bombs to nuclear weapons br The primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean Early submarines could be detected by the sound they made Water is an excellent conductor of sound much better than air and submarines can detect and track comparatively noisy surface ships from long distances Modern submarines are built with an emphasis on stealth Advanced propeller designs extensive sound reducing insulation and special machinery help a submarine remain as quiet as ambient ocean noise making them difficult to detect It takes specialized technology to find and attack modern submarines br br Active sonar uses the reflection of sound emitted from the search equipment to detect submarines It has been used since WWII by surface ships submarines and aircraft via dropped buoys and helicopter dipping arrays but it reveals the emitter s position and is susceptible to counter measures br A concealed military submarine is a real threat and because of its stealth can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack This advantage was vividly demonstrated in the Falklands War when the British nuclear powered submarine HMS Conqueror sank the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano After the sinking the Argentine Navy recognized that they had no effective defense against submarine attack and the Argentine surface fleet withdrew to port for the remainder of the war An Argentine submarine remained at sea however br br br Civilian br Although the majority of the world s submarines are military there are some civilian submarines which are used for tourism exploration oil and gas platform inspections and pipeline surveys Some are also used in illegal activities br The Submarine Voyage ride opened at Disneyland in but although it ran under water it was not a true submarine as it ran on tracks and was open to the atmosphere The first tourist submarine was Auguste Piccard which went into service in at Expo By there were tourist submarines operating around the world Submarines with a crush depth in the range of feet m are operated in several areas worldwide typically with bottom depths around to feet to m with a carrying capacity of to passengers br In a typical operation a surface vessel carries passengers to an offshore operating area and loads them into the submarine The submarine then visits underwater points of interest such as natural or artificial reef structures To surface safely without danger of collision the location of the submarine is marked with an air release and movement to the surface is coordinated by an observer in a support craft br A recent development is the deployment of so called narco submarines by South American drug smugglers to evade law enforcement detection Although they occasionally deploy true submarines most are self propelled semi submersibles where a portion of the craft remains above water at all times In September Colombian authorities seized a meter long submersible that could hold a crew of costing about million The vessel belonged to FARC rebels and had the capacity to carry at least tonnes of drugs br br Civilian submarines br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Polar operations br br Simon

class submarine HMS Tireless br March USS Annapolis took part in Ice Exercise to test submarine operability and war fighting capability in Arctic conditions br br br Technology br br br Buoyancy and trim br br All surface ships as well as surfaced submarines are in a positively buoyant condition weighing less than the volume of water they would displace if fully submerged To submerge hydrostatically a ship must have negative buoyancy either by increasing its own weight or decreasing its displacement of water To control their displacement and weight submarines have ballast tanks which can hold varying amounts of water and air br For general submersion or surfacing submarines use the main ballast tanks MBTs which are ambient pressure tanks filled with water to submerge or with air to surface While submerged MBTs generally remain flooded which simplifies their design and on many submarines these tanks are a section of the space between the light hull and the pressure hull For more precise control of depth submarines use smaller depth control tanks DCTs also called hard tanks due to their ability to withstand higher pressure or trim tanks These are variable buoyancy pressure vessels a type of buoyancy control device The amount of water in depth control tanks can be adjusted to hydrostatically change depth or to maintain a constant depth as outside conditions mainly water density change Depth control tanks may be located either near the submarine s center of gravity to minimise the effect on trim or separated along the length of the hull so they can also be used to adjust static trim by transfer of water between them br When submerged the water pressure on a submarine s hull can reach MPa psi for steel submarines and up to MPa psi for titanium submarines like K Komsomolets while interior pressure remains relatively unchanged This difference results in hull compression which decreases displacement Water density also marginally increases with depth as the salinity and pressure are higher This change in density incompletely compensates for hull compression so buoyancy decreases as depth increases A submerged submarine is in an unstable equilibrium having a tendency to either sink or float to the surface Keeping a constant depth requires continual operation of either the depth control tanks or control surfaces br Submarines in a neutral buoyancy condition are not intrinsically trim stable To maintain desired longitudinal trim submarines use forward and aft trim tanks Pumps move water between the tanks changing weight distribution and pitching the sub up or down A similar system may be used to maintain transverse trim br br br Control surfaces br br The hydrostatic effect of variable ballast tanks is not the only way to control the submarine underwater Hydrodynamic maneuvering is done by several control surfaces collectively known as diving planes or hydroplanes which can be moved to create hydrodynamic forces when a submarine moves longitudinally at sufficient speed In the classic cruciform stern configuration the horizontal stern planes serve the same purpose as the trim tanks controlling the trim Most submarines additionally have forward horizontal planes normally placed on the bow until the s but often on the sail on later designs where they are closer to the center of gravity and can control depth with less effect on the trim br br An obvious way to configure the control surfaces at the stern of a submarine is to use vertical planes to control yaw and horizontal planes to control pitch which gives them the shape of a cross when seen from astern of the vessel In this configuration which long remained the dominant one the horizontal planes are used to control the trim and depth and the vertical planes to control sideways maneuvers like the rudder of a surface ship br Alternatively the rear control surfaces can be combined into what has become known as an x stern or an x rudder Although less intuitive such a configuration has turned out to have several advantages over the traditional cruciform arrangement First it improves maneuverability horizontally as well as vertically Second the control surfaces are less likely to get damaged when landing on or departing from the seabed as well as when mooring and unmooring alongside Finally it is safer in that one of the two diagonal lines can counteract the other with respect to vertical as well as horizontal motion if one of them accidentally gets stuck br br The x stern was first tried in practice in the early s on the USS Albacore an experimental submarine of the US Navy While the arrangement was found to be advantageous it was nevertheless not used on US production submarines that followed due to the fact that it requires the use of a computer to manipulate the control surfaces to the desired effect Instead the first to use an x stern in standard operations was the Swedish Navy with its Sj ormen class the lead submarine of which was launched in before the Albacore had even finished her test runs Since it turned out to work very well in practice all subsequent classes of Swedish submarines N cken V sterg tland Gotland and Blekinge class have or will come with an x rudder br br The Kockums shipyard responsible for the design of the x stern on Swedish submarines eventually exported it to Australia with the Collins class as well as to Japan with the S ry class With the introduction of the type the German and Italian Navies came to feature it as well The US Navy with its Columbia class the British Navy with its Dreadnought class and the French Navy with its Barracuda class are all about to join the x stern family Hence as judged by the situation in the early s the x stern is about to become the dominant technology br When a submarine performs an emergency surfacing all depth and trim control methods are used simultaneously together with propelling the boat upwards Such surfacing is very quick so the vessel may even partially jump out of the water potentially damaging submarine systems br br br Hull br br br Overview br br Modern submarines are cigar shaped This design also used in very early submarines is sometimes called a teardrop hull It reduces hydrodynamic drag when the sub is submerged but decreases the sea keeping capabilities and increases drag while surfaced Since the limitations of the propulsion systems of early submarines forced them to operate surfaced most of the time their hull designs were a compromise Because of the slow submerged speeds of those subs usually well below kt km h the increased drag for underwater travel was acceptable Late in World War II when technology allowed faster and longer submerged operation and increased aircraft surveillance forced submarines to stay submerged hull designs became teardrop shaped again to reduce drag and noise USS Albacore AGSS was a unique research submarine that pioneered the American version of the teardrop hull form sometimes referred to as an Albacore hull of modern submarines On modern military submarines the outer hull is covered with a layer of sound absorbing rubber or anechoic plating to reduce detection br The occupied pressure hulls of deep diving submarines such as DSV Alvin are spherical instead of cylindrical This allows a more even distribution of stress and efficient use of materials to withstand external pressure as it gives the most internal volume for structural weight and is the most efficient shape to avoid buckling instability in compression A frame is usually affixed to the outside of the pressure hull providing attachment for ballast and trim systems scientific instrumentation battery packs syntactic flotation foam and lighting br A raised tower on top of a standard submarine accommodates the periscope and electronics masts which can include radio radar electronic warfare and other systems It might also include a snorkel mast In many early classes of submarines see history the control room or conn was located inside this tower which was known as the conning tower Since then the conn has been located within the hull of the submarine and the tower is now called the sail or fin The conn is distinct from the bridge a small open platform in the top of the sail used for observation during surface operation br Bathtubs are related to conning towers but are used on smaller submarines The bathtub is a metal cylinder surrounding the hatch that prevents waves from breaking directly into the cabin It is needed because surfaced submarines have limited freeboard that is they lie low in the water Bathtubs help prevent swamping the vessel br br br Single and double hulls br br Modern submarines and submersibles usually have as did the earliest models a single hull Large submarines generally have an additional hull or hull sections outside This external hull which actually forms the shape of submarine is called the outer hull casing in the Royal Navy or light hull as it does not have to withstand a pressure difference Inside the outer hull there is a strong hull or pressure hull which withstands sea pressure and has normal atmospheric pressure inside br As early as World War I it was realized that the optimal shape for withstanding pressure conflicted with the optimal shape for seakeeping and minimal drag at the surface and construction difficulties further complicated the problem This was solved either by a compromise shape or by using two layered hulls the internal strength hull for withstanding pressure and an external fairing for hydrodynamic shape Until the end of World War II most submarines had an additional partial casing on the top bow and stern built of thinner metal which was flooded when submerged Germany went further with the Type XXI a general predecessor of modern submarines in which the pressure hull was fully enclosed inside the light hull but optimized for submerged navigation unlike earlier designs that were optimized for surface operation br br After World War II approaches split The Soviet Union changed its designs basing them on German developments All post World War II heavy Soviet and Russian submarines are built with a double hull structure American and most other Western submarines switched to a primarily single hull approach They still have light hull sections in the bow and stern which house main ballast tanks and provide a hydrodynamically optimized shape but the main cylindrical hull section has only a single plating layer Double hulls are being considered for future submarines in the United States to improve payload capacity stealth and range br br br Pressure hull br br The pressure hull is generally constructed of thick high strength steel with a complex structure and high strength reserve and is separated by watertight bulkheads into several compartments There are also examples of more than two hulls in a submarine like the Typhoon class which has two main pressure hulls and three smaller ones for control room torpedoes and steering gear with the missile launch system between the main hulls all surrounded and supported by the outer light hydrodynamic hull When submerged the pressure hull provides most of the buoyancy for the whole vessel br The dive depth cannot be increased easily Simply making the hull thicker increases the structural weight and requires reduction of onboard equipment weight and increasing the diameter requires a proportional increase in thickness for the same material and architecture ultimately resulting in a pressure hull that does not have sufficient buoyancy to support its own weight as in a bathyscaphe This is acceptable for civilian research submersibles but not military submarines which need to carry a large equipment crew and weapons load to fulfill their function Construction materials with greater specific strength and specific modulus are needed br WWI submarines had hulls of carbon steel with a metre ft maximum depth During WWII high strength alloyed steel was introduced allowing metre ft depths High strength alloy steel remains the primary material for submarines today with metre ft depths which cannot be exceeded on a military submarine without design compromises To exceed that limit a few submarines were built with titanium hulls Titanium alloys can be stronger than steel lighter and most importantly have higher immersed specific strength and specific modulus Titanium is also not ferromagnetic important for stealth Titanium submarines were built by the Soviet Union which developed specialized high strength alloys It has produced several types of titanium submarines Titanium alloys allow a major increase in depth but other systems must be redesigned to cope so test depth was limited to metres ft for the Soviet submarine K Komsomolets the deepest diving combat submarine An Alfa class submarine may have successfully operated at metres ft though continuous operation at such depths would produce excessive stress on many submarine systems Titanium does not flex as readily as steel and may become brittle after many dive cycles Despite its benefits the high cost of titanium construction led to the abandonment of titanium submarine construction as the Cold War ended Deep diving civilian submarines have used thick acrylic pressure hulls Although the specific strength and specific modulus of acrylic are not very high the density is only g cm so it is only very slightly denser than water and the buoyancy penalty of increased thickness is correspondingly low br The deepest deep submergence vehicle DSV to date is Trieste On October Trieste departed San Diego for Guam aboard the freighter Santa Maria to participate in Project Nekton a series of very deep dives in the Mariana Trench On January Trieste reached the ocean floor in the Challenger Deep the deepest southern part of the Mariana Trench carrying Jacques Piccard son of Auguste and Lieutenant Don Walsh USN This was the first time a vessel crewed or uncrewed had reached the deepest point in the Earth s oceans The onboard systems indicated a depth of metres ft although this was later revised to metres ft and more accurate measurements made in have found the Challenger Deep slightly shallower at metres ft br Building a pressure hull is difficult as it must withstand pressures at its required diving depth When the hull is perfectly round in cross section the pressure is evenly distributed and causes only hull compression If the shape is not perfect the hull deflects more in some places and buckling instability is the usual failure mode Inevitable minor deviations are resisted by stiffener rings but even a one inch mm deviation from roundness results in over percent decrease of maximal hydrostatic load and consequently dive depth The hull must therefore be constructed with high precision All hull parts must be welded without defects and all joints are checked multiple times with different methods contributing to the high cost of modern submarines For example each Virginia class attack submarine costs US billion over US per ton of displacement br br br Propulsion br br The first submarines were propelled by humans The first mechanically driven submarine was the French Plongeur which used compressed air for propulsion Anaerobic propulsion was first employed by the Spanish Ictineo II in which used a solution of zinc manganese dioxide and potassium chlorate to generate sufficient heat to power a steam engine while also providing oxygen for the crew A similar system was not employed again until when the German Navy tested a hydrogen peroxide based system the Walter turbine on the experimental V submarine and later on the naval U and type XVII submarines the system was further developed for the British Explorer class completed in br Until the advent of nuclear marine propulsion most th century submarines used electric motors and batteries for running underwater and combustion engines on the surface and for battery recharging Early submarines used gasoline petrol engines but this quickly gave way to kerosene paraffin and then diesel engines because of reduced flammability and with diesel improved fuel efficiency and thus also greater range A combination of diesel and electric propulsion became the norm br Initially the combustion engine and the electric motor were in most cases connected to the same shaft so that both could directly drive the propeller The combustion engine was placed at the front end of the stern section with the electric motor behind it followed by the propeller shaft The engine was connected to the motor by a clutch and the motor in turn connected to the propeller shaft by another clutch br With only the rear clutch engaged the electric motor could drive the propeller as required for fully submerged operation With both clutches engaged the combustion engine could drive the propeller as was possible when operating on the surface or at a later stage when snorkeling The electric motor would in this case serve as a generator to charge the batteries or if no charging was needed be allowed to rotate freely With only the front clutch engaged the combustion engine could drive the electric motor as a generator for charging the batteries without simultaneously forcing the propeller to move br The motor could have multiple armatures on the shaft which could be electrically coupled in series for slow speed and in parallel for high speed these connections were called group down and group up respectively br br br Diesel electric transmission br br While most early submarines used a direct mechanical connection between the combustion engine and the propeller an alternative solution was considered as well as implemented at a very early stage That solution consists in first converting the work of the combustion engine into electric energy via a dedicated generator This energy is then used to drive the propeller via the electric motor and to the extent required for charging the batteries In this configuration the electric motor is thus responsible for driving the propeller at all times regardless of whether air is available so that the combustion engine can also be used or not br Among the pioneers of this alternative solution was the very first submarine of the Swedish Navy HMS Hajen later renamed Ub no launched in While its design was generally inspired by the first submarine commissioned by the US Navy USS Holland it deviated from the latter in at least three significant ways by adding a periscope by replacing the gasoline engine by a semidiesel engine a hot bulb engine primarily meant to be fueled by kerosene later replaced by a true diesel engine and by severing the mechanical link between the combustion engine and the propeller by instead letting the former drive a dedicated generator By so doing it took three significant steps toward what was eventually to become the dominant technology for conventional i e non nuclear submarines br br In the following years the Swedish Navy added another seven submarines in three different classes nd class Laxen class and Braxen class using the same propulsion technology but fitted with true diesel engines rather than semidiesels from the outset Since by that time the technology was usually based on the diesel engine rather than some other type of combustion engine it eventually came to be known as diesel electric transmission br Like many other early submarines those initially designed in Sweden were quite small less than tonnes and thus confined to littoral operation When the Swedish Navy wanted to add larger vessels capable of operating further from the shore their designs were purchased from companies abroad that already had the required experience first Italian Fiat Laurenti and later German A G Weser and IvS As a side effect the diesel electric transmission was temporarily abandoned br However diesel electric transmission was immediately reintroduced when Sweden began designing its own submarines again in the mid s From that point onwards it has been consistently used for all new classes of Swedish submarines albeit supplemented by air independent propulsion AIP as provided by Stirling engines beginning with HMS N cken in br br Another early adopter of diesel electric transmission was the US Navy whose Bureau of Engineering proposed its use in It was subsequently tried in the S class submarines S S and S before being put into production with the Porpoise class of the s From that point onwards it continued to be used on most US conventional submarines br Apart from the British U class and some submarines of the Imperial Japanese Navy that used separate diesel generators for low speed running few navies other than those of Sweden and the US made much use of diesel electric transmission before After World War II by contrast it gradually became the dominant mode of propulsion for conventional submarines However its adoption was not always swift Notably the Soviet Navy did not introduce diesel electric transmission on its conventional submarines until with its Paltus class br If diesel electric transmission had only brought advantages and no disadvantages in comparison with a system that mechanically connects the diesel engine to the propeller it would undoubtedly have become dominant much earlier The disadvantages include the following br br It entails a loss of fuel efficiency as well as power by converting the output of the diesel engine into electricity While both generators and electric motors are known to be very efficient their efficiency nevertheless falls short of percent br It requires an additional component in the form of a dedicated generator Since the electric motor is always used to drive the propeller it can no longer step in to take on generator service as well br It does not allow the diesel engine and the electrical motor to join forces by simultaneously driving the propeller mechanically for maximum speed when the submarine is surfaced or snorkeling This may however be of little practical importance inasmuch as the option it prevents is one that would leave the submarine at a risk of having to dive with its batteries at least partly depleted br The reason why diesel electric transmission has become the dominant alternative in spite of these disadvantages is of course that it also comes with many advantages and that on balance these have eventually been found to be more important The advantages include the following br br It reduces external noise by severing the direct and rigid mechanical link between the relatively noisy diesel engine s on the one hand and the propeller shaft s and hull on the other With stealth being of paramount importance to submarines this is a very significant advantage br It increases the readiness to dive which is of course of vital importance for a submarine The only thing required from a propulsion point of view is to shut down the diesel s br It makes the speed of the diesel engine s temporarily independent of the speed of the submarine This in turn often makes it possible to run the diesel s at close to optimal speed from a fuel efficiency as well as durability point of view It also makes it possible to reduce the time spent surfaced or snorkeling by running the diesel s at maximum speed without affecting the speed of the submarine itself br It eliminates the clutches otherwise required to connect the diesel engine the electric motor and the propeller shaft This in turn saves space increases reliability and reduces maintenance costs br It increases flexibility with regard to how the driveline components are configured positioned and maintained For example the diesel no longer has to be aligned with the electric motor and propeller shaft two diesels can be used to power a single propeller or vice versa and one diesel can be turned off for maintenance as long as a second is available to provide the required amount of electricity br It facilitates the integration of additional primary sources of energy beside the diesel engine s such as various kinds of air independent power AIP systems With one or more electric motors always driving the propeller s such systems can easily be introduced as yet another source of electric energy in addition to the diesel engine s and the batteries br br br Snorkel br br During World War II the Germans experimented with the idea of the schnorchel snorkel from captured Dutch submarines but did not see the need for them until rather late in the war The schnorchel is a retractable pipe that supplies air to the diesel engines while submerged at periscope depth allowing the boat to cruise and recharge its batteries while maintaining a degree of stealth br Especially as first implemented however it turned out to be far from a perfect solution There were problems with the device s valve sticking shut or closing as it dunked in rough weather Since the system used the entire pressure hull as a buffer the diesels would instantaneously suck huge volumes of air from the boat s compartments and the crew often suffered painful ear injuries Speed was limited to knots km h lest the device snap from stress The schnorchel also created noise that made the boat easier to detect with sonar yet more difficult for the on board sonar to detect signals from other vessels Finally allied radar eventually became sufficiently advanced that the schnorchel mast could be detected beyond visual range br While the snorkel renders a submarine far less detectable it is thus not perfect In clear weather diesel exhausts can be seen on the surface to a distance of about three miles while periscope feather the wave created by the snorkel or periscope moving through the water is visible from far off in calm sea conditions Modern radar is also capable of detecting a snorkel in calm sea conditions br br The problem of the diesels causing a vacuum in the submarine when the head valve is submerged still exists in later model diesel submarines but is mitigated by high vacuum cut off sensors that shut down the engines when the vacuum in the ship reaches a pre set point Modern snorkel induction masts have a fail safe design using compressed air controlled by a simple electrical circuit to hold the head valve open against the pull of a powerful spring Seawater washing over the mast shorts out exposed electrodes on top breaking the control and shutting the head valve while it is submerged US submarines did not adopt the use of snorkels until after WWII br br br Air independent propulsion br br During World War II German Type XXI submarines also known as Elektroboote were the first submarines designed to operate submerged for extended periods Initially they were to carry hydrogen peroxide for long term fast air independent propulsion but were ultimately built with very large batteries instead At the end of the War the British and Soviets experimented with hydrogen peroxide kerosene paraffin engines that could run surfaced and submerged The results were not encouraging Though the Soviet Union deployed a class of submarines with this engine type codenamed Quebec by NATO they were considered unsuccessful br The United States also used hydrogen peroxide in an experimental midget submarine X It was originally powered by a hydrogen peroxide diesel engine and battery system until an explosion of her hydrogen peroxide supply on May X was later converted to use diesel electric drive br Today several navies use air independent propulsion Notably Sweden uses Stirling technology on the Gotland class and S dermanland class submarines The Stirling engine is heated by burning diesel fuel with liquid oxygen from cryogenic tanks A newer development in air independent propulsion is hydrogen fuel cells first used on the German Type submarine with nine kW or two kW cells Fuel cells are also used in the new Spanish S class submarines although with the fuel stored as ethanol and then converted into hydrogen before use br One new technology that is being introduced starting with the Japanese Navy s eleventh S ry class submarine JS ry is a more modern battery the lithium ion battery These batteries have about double the electric storage of traditional batteries and by changing out the lead acid batteries in their normal storage areas plus filling up the large hull space normally devoted to AIP engine and fuel tanks with many tons of lithium ion batteries modern submarines can actually return to a pure diesel electric configuration yet have the added underwater range and power normally associated with AIP equipped submarines br br br Nuclear power br br Steam power was resurrected in the s with a nuclear powered steam turbine driving a generator By eliminating the need for atmospheric oxygen the time that a submarine could remain submerged was limited only by its food stores as breathing air was recycled and fresh water distilled from seawater More importantly a nuclear submarine has unlimited range at top speed This allows it to travel from its operating base to the combat zone in a much shorter time and makes it a far more difficult target for most anti submarine weapons Nuclear powered submarines have a relatively small battery and diesel engine generator powerplant for emergency use if the reactors must be shut down br Nuclear power is now used in all large submarines but due to the high cost and large size of nuclear reactors smaller submarines still use diesel electric propulsion The ratio of larger to smaller submarines depends on strategic needs The US Navy French Navy and the British Royal Navy operate only nuclear submarines which is explained by the need for distant operations Other major operators rely on a mix of nuclear submarines for strategic purposes and diesel electric submarines for defense Most fleets have no nuclear submarines due to the limited availability of nuclear power and submarine technology br Diesel electric submarines have a stealth advantage over their nuclear counterparts Nuclear submarines generate noise from coolant pumps and turbo machinery needed to operate the reactor even at low power levels Some nuclear submarines such as the American Ohio class can operate with their reactor coolant pumps secured making them quieter than electric subs A conventional submarine operating on batteries is almost completely silent the only noise coming from the shaft bearings propeller and flow noise around the hull all of which stops when the sub hovers in mid water to listen leaving only the noise from crew activity Commercial submarines usually rely only on batteries since they operate in conjunction with a mother ship br Several serious nuclear and radiation accidents have involved nuclear submarine mishaps The Soviet submarine K reactor accident in resulted in deaths and more than other people were over exposed to radiation The Soviet submarine K reactor accident in resulted in fatalities and other injuries The Soviet submarine K accident in resulted in fatalities and other radiation injuries br br br Alternative br Oil fired steam turbines powered the British K class submarines built during World War I and later to give them the surface speed to keep up with the battle fleet The K class subs were not very successful however br Toward the end of the th century some submarines such as the British Vanguard class began to be fitted with pump jet propulsors instead of propellers Though these are heavier more expensive and less efficient than a propeller they are significantly quieter providing an important tactical advantage br br br Armament br br The success of the submarine is inextricably linked to the development of the torpedo invented by Robert Whitehead in His invention essentially the same now as it was years ago allowed the submarine make the leap from novelty to a weapon of war Prior to the development and miniaturization of sonar sensitive enough to track a submerged submarine attacks were exclusively restricted to ships and submarines operating near or at the surface Targeting of unguided torpedoes was initially done by eye but by World War II analog targeting computers began to proliferate being able to calculate basic firing solutions Nonetheless multiple straight running torpedoes could be required to ensure a target was hit With at most to torpedoes stored on board the number of attacks a submarine could make was limited To increase combat endurance starting in World War I submarines also functioned as submersible gunboats using their deck guns against unarmed targets and diving to escape and engage enemy warships The initial importance of these deck guns encouraged the development of the unsuccessful Submarine Cruiser such as the French Surcouf and the Royal Navy s X and M class submarines With the arrival of anti submarine warfare ASW aircraft guns became more for defense than attack A more practical method of increasing combat endurance was the external torpedo tube loaded only in port br The ability of submarines to approach enemy harbours covertly led to their use as minelayers Minelaying submarines of World War I and World War II were specially built for that purpose Modern submarine laid mines such as the British Mark Stonefish and Mark Sea Urchin can be deployed from a submarine s torpedo tubes br After World War II both the US and the USSR experimented with submarine launched cruise missiles such as the SSM N Regulus and P Pyatyorka Such missiles required the submarine to surface to fire its missiles They were the forerunners of modern submarine launched cruise missiles which can be fired from the torpedo tubes of submerged submarines for example the US BGM Tomahawk and Russian RPK Viyuga and versions of surface to surface anti ship missiles such as the Exocet and Harpoon encapsulated for submarine launch Ballistic missiles can also be fired from a submarine s torpedo tubes for example missiles such as the anti submarine SUBROC With internal volume as limited as ever and the desire to carry heavier warloads the idea of the external launch tube was revived usually for encapsulated missiles with such tubes being placed between the internal pressure and outer streamlined hulls Guided torpedoes also proliferated extensively during and after World War II even further increasing the combat endurance and lethality of submarines and allowing them to engage other submarines at depth with the latter now being one of the primary missions of the modern attack submarine br The strategic mission of the SSM N and the P was taken up by submarine launched ballistic missile beginning with the US Navy s Polaris missile and subsequently the Poseidon and Trident missiles br Germany is working on the torpedo tube launched short range IDAS missile which can be used against ASW helicopters as well as surface ships and coastal targets br br br Sensors br br A submarine can have a variety of sensors depending on its missions Modern military submarines rely almost entirely on a suite of passive and active sonars to locate targets Active sonar relies on an audible ping to generate echoes to reveal objects around the submarine Active systems are rarely used as doing so reveals the sub s presence Passive sonar is a set of sensitive hydrophones set into the hull or trailed in a towed array normally trailing several hundred feet behind the sub The towed array is the mainstay of NATO submarine detection systems as it reduces the flow noise heard by operators Hull mounted sonar is employed in addition to the towed array as the towed array can not work in shallow depth and during maneuvering In addition sonar has a blind spot through the submarine so a system on both the front and back works to eliminate that problem As the towed array trails behind and below the submarine it also allows the submarine to have a system both above and below the thermocline at the proper depth sound passing through the thermocline is distorted resulting in a lower detection range br Submarines also carry radar equipment to detect surface ships and aircraft Submarine captains are more likely to use radar detection gear than active radar to detect targets as radar can be detected far beyond its own return range revealing the submarine Periscopes are rarely used except for position fixes and to verify a contact s identity br Civilian submarines such as the DSV Alvin or the Russian Mir submersibles rely on small active sonar sets and viewing ports to navigate The human eye cannot detect sunlight below about feet m underwater so high intensity lights are used to illuminate the viewing area br br br Navigation br br Early submarines had few navigation aids but modern subs have a variety of navigation systems Modern military submarines use an inertial guidance system for navigation while submerged but drift error unavoidably builds over time To counter this the crew occasionally uses the Global Positioning System to obtain an accurate position The periscope a retractable tube with a prism system that provides a view of the surface is only used occasionally in modern submarines since the visibility range is short The Virginia class and Astute class submarines use photonics masts rather than hull penetrating optical periscopes These masts must still be deployed above the surface and use electronic sensors for visible light infrared laser range finding and electromagnetic surveillance One benefit to hoisting the mast above the surface is that while the mast is above the water the entire sub is still below the water and is much harder to detect visually or by radar br br br Communication br br Military submarines use several systems to communicate with distant command centers or other ships One is VLF very low frequency radio which can reach a submarine either on the surface or submerged to a fairly shallow depth usually less than feet m ELF extremely low frequency can reach a submarine at greater depths but has a very low bandwidth and is generally used to call a submerged sub to a shallower depth where VLF signals can reach A submarine also has the option of floating a long buoyant wire antenna to a shallower depth allowing VLF transmissions by a deeply submerged boat br By extending a radio mast a submarine can also use a burst transmission technique A burst transmission takes only a fraction of a second minimizing a submarine s risk of detection br To communicate with other submarines a system known as Gertrude is used Gertrude is basically a sonar telephone Voice communication from one submarine is transmitted by low power speakers into the water where it is detected by passive sonars on the receiving submarine The range of this system is probably very short and using it radiates sound into the water which can be heard by the enemy br Civilian submarines can use similar albeit less powerful systems to communicate with support ships or other submersibles in the area br br br Life support systems br With nuclear power or air independent propulsion submarines can remain submerged for months at a time Conventional diesel submarines must periodically resurface or run on snorkel to recharge their batteries Most modern military submarines generate breathing oxygen by electrolysis of fresh water using a device called an Electrolytic Oxygen Generator Emergency oxygen can be produced by burning sodium chlorate candles Atmosphere control equipment includes a Carbon dioxide scrubber which uses a spray of monoethanolamine MEA absorbent to remove the gas from the air after which the MEA is heated in a boiler to release the CO which is then pumped overboard Emergency scrubbing can also be done with lithium hydroxide which is consumable A machine that uses a catalyst to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide removed by the CO scrubber and bonds hydrogen produced from the ship s storage battery with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce water is also used An atmosphere monitoring system samples the air from different areas of the ship for nitrogen oxygen hydrogen R and R refrigerants carbon dioxide carbon monoxide and other gases Poisonous gases are removed and oxygen is replenished by use of an oxygen bank located in a main ballast tank Some heavier submarines have two oxygen bleed stations forward and aft The oxygen in the air is sometimes kept a few percent less than atmospheric concentration to reduce fire risk br Fresh water is produced by either an evaporator or a reverse osmosis unit The primary use for fresh water is to provide feedwater for the reactor and steam propulsion plants It is also available for showers sinks cooking and cleaning once propulsion plant needs have been met Seawater is used to flush toilets and the resulting blackwater is stored in a sanitary tank until it is blown overboard using pressurized air or pumped overboard by using a special sanitary pump The blackwater discharge system requires skill to operate and isolation valves must be closed before discharge The German Type VIIC boat U was lost with casualties because of human error while using this system Water from showers and sinks is stored separately in grey water tanks and discharged overboard using drain pumps br Trash on modern large submarines is usually disposed of using a tube called a Trash Disposal Unit TDU where it is compacted into a galvanized steel can At the bottom of the TDU is a large ball valve An ice plug is set on top of the ball valve to protect it the cans atop the ice plug The top breech door is shut and the TDU is flooded and equalized with sea pressure the ball valve is opened and the cans fall out assisted by scrap iron weights in the cans The TDU is also flushed with seawater to ensure it is completely empty and the ball valve is clear before closing the valve br br br Crew br br A typical nuclear submarine has a crew of over conventional boats typically have fewer than The conditions on a submarine can be difficult because crew members must work in isolation for long periods of time without family contact and in cramped conditions Submarines normally maintain radio silence to avoid detection Operating a submarine is dangerous even in peacetime and many submarines have been lost in accidents br br br Women br br Most navies prohibited women from serving on submarines even after they had been permitted to serve on surface warships The Royal Norwegian Navy became the first navy to allow women on its submarine crews in The Royal Danish Navy allowed female submariners in Others followed suit including the Swedish Navy the Royal Australian Navy the Spanish Navy the German Navy and the Canadian Navy In Solveig Krey of the Royal Norwegian Navy became the first female officer to assume command on a military submarine HNoMS Kobben br On December British Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced that the UK s ban on women in submarines was to be lifted from Previously there were fears that women were more at risk from a build up of carbon dioxide in the submarine But a study showed no medical reason to exclude women though pregnant women would still be excluded Similar dangers to the pregnant woman and her fetus barred women from submarine service in Sweden in when all other positions were made available for them in the Swedish Navy Today pregnant women are still not allowed to serve on submarines in Sweden However the policymakers thought that it was discriminatory with a general ban and demanded that women should be tried on their individual merits and have their suitability evaluated and compared to other candidates Further they noted that a woman complying with such high demands is unlikely to become pregnant In May three women became the RN s first female submariners br Women have served on US Navy surface ships since and as of began serving on submarines for the first time Until presently the Navy allowed only three exceptions to women being on board military submarines female civilian technicians for a few days at most women midshipmen on an overnight during summer training for Navy ROTC and Naval Academy and family members for one day dependent cruises In senior officials including then Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus Joint Chief of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gary Roughead began the process of finding a way to implement women on submarines The US Navy rescinded its no women on subs policy in br Both the US and British navies operate nuclear powered submarines that deploy for periods of six months or longer Other navies that permit women to serve on submarines operate conventionally powered submarines which deploy for much shorter periods usually only for a few months Prior to the change by the US no nation using nuclear submarines permitted women to serve on board br In the first class of female submarine officers graduated from Naval Submarine School s Submarine Officer Basic Course SOBC at the Naval Submarine Base New London Additionally more senior ranking and experienced female supply officers from the surface warfare specialty attended SOBC as well proceeding to fleet Ballistic Missile SSBN and Guided Missile SSGN submarines along with the new female submarine line officers beginning in late By late several women were assigned to the Ohio class ballistic missile submarine USS Wyoming On October the US Navy announced that two of the smaller Virginia class attack submarines USS Virginia and USS Minnesota would have female crew members by January br In Japan s national naval submarine academy accepted its first female candidate br br br Abandoning the vessel br br In an emergency submarines can contact other ships to assist in rescue and pick up the crew when they abandon ship The crew can use escape sets such as the Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment to abandon the submarine via an escape trunk which is a small airlock compartment that provides a route for crew to escape from a downed submarine at ambient pressure in small groups while minimising the amount of water admitted to the submarine The crew can avoid lung injury from over expansion of air in the lungs due to the pressure change known as pulmonary barotrauma by maintaining an open airway and exhaling during the ascent Following escape from a pressurized submarine in which the air pressure is higher than atmospheric due to water ingress or other reasons the crew is at risk of developing decompression sickness on return to surface pressure br An alternative escape means is via a deep submergence rescue vehicle that can dock onto the disabled submarine establish a seal around the escape hatch and transfer personnel at the same pressure as the interior of the submarine If the submarine has been pressurised the survivors can lock into a decompression chamber on the submarine rescue ship and transfer under pressure for safe surface decompression br br br See also br br br By country br List of submarine operators br Australia Collins class
