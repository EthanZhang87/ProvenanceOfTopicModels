A warship or combatant ship is a ship that is built and primarily intended for naval warfare Usually they belong to the navy branch of the armed forces of a nation though they have also been operated by individuals cooperatives and corporations As well as being armed warships are designed to withstand damage and are typically faster and more maneuverable than merchant ships Unlike a merchant ship which carries cargo a warship typically carries only weapons ammunition and supplies for its crew br In wartime the distinction between warships and merchant ships is often blurred Until the th century it was common for merchant ships to be pressed into naval service and not unusual for more than half of a fleet to be composed of merchant ships there was not a large difference in construction unlike the difference between a heavily armoured battleship and an ocean liner Until the threat of piracy subsided in the th century it was normal practice to arm larger merchant ships such as galleons Warships have also often been used as troop carriers or supply ships such as by the French Navy in the th century or the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Second World War In war since the early th century merchant ships were often armed and used as auxiliary warships such as the Q ships of the First World War and the armed merchant cruisers of the Second World War br br br Types and classes br The main types of warships today are in order of decresing size amphibious assault ships and aircraft carriers cruisers destroyers frigates corvettes fast attack boats A more extensive list follows br br Amphibious warfare ships are warships employed to land and support ground forces such as marines on enemy territory during an amphibious assault br Amphibious assault ship is a type of amphibious warfare ship employed to land and support ground forces with ship deployed helicopters and V STOL aircraft on enemy territory by an amphibious assault br Amphibious transport dock is an amphibious warfare ship that embarks transports and lands elements of a landing force for expeditionary warfare missions br Dock landing ship is an amphibious warfare ship with a well dock to transport and launch landing craft and amphibious vehicles br Landing craft are small and medium seagoing watercraft such as boats and barges used to convey a landing force infantry and vehicles from the sea to the shore during an amphibious assault br Landing Craft Utility is a type of landing craft used by amphibious forces to transport equipment and troops to the shore They are capable of transporting tracked or wheeled vehicles and marines from amphibious assault ships to beachheads br Landing Craft Mechanized is a landing craft designed for carrying vehicles during amphibious assaults br Landing ship tank is the naval designation for ships first developed during World War II to support amphibious operations by carrying tanks armoured fighting vehicles transport vehicles cargo and landing troops directly onto shore with no docks or piers br Landing Craft Support were two distinct classes of amphibious warfare vessels used by the United States Navy during World War II to support landing crafts br Armed merchantman is a type of merchant ship equipped with naval guns usually for defensive purposes either by design or after the fact In the days of sail piracy and privateers br Armed yachts were modified yachts that were armed with weapons and were typically in the service of a navy br Balloon carrier was a type of ship equipped with a hot air balloon tied to the ship with a rope or cable which was used for observation This type of ship was later replaced by the seaplane carrier br Cottonclad warships were steam powered warships with bales of cotton lining as armour used in the American Civil War The armaments consisted of a ram random numbers of different cannons and sharpshooters br Dispatch boats were small boats and sometimes large ships tasked to carry military dispatches from ship to ship or from ship to shore or in some cases from shore to shore Dispatch boats were employed when other means of transmitting a message was not possible or safe or as quick br Aviso a kind of dispatch boat br Brig of War is a brig armed for use by a navy br Anti submarine warfare carrier is a type of small aircraft carrier whose primary role is as the nucleus of an anti submarine warfare hunter killer group br Capital ship the largest and most important ships in a nation s fleet These were previously battleships battlecruisers and aircraft carriers but the first two warship types are now no longer used br Aircraft carrier a warship primarily armed with carrier based aircraft br Fleet carrier is an aircraft carrier designed to operate with the main fleet of a nation s navy br Light aircraft carrier is an aircraft carrier that is smaller than the standard carriers of a navy br Escort carrier also called a jeep carrier or baby flattop is a slow type of aircraft carrier used during WWII br Battlecruiser a ship with battleship level armament and cruiser level armour typically faster than a battleship because the reduction in armour allowed mounting of more powerful propulsion machinery or the use of a more slender hull shape with a lower drag coefficient br Battleship a large heavily armored warship equipped with many powerful guns A term which generally post dates sailing warships br Ironclad battleship battleships built before the pre dreadnought in the late s to the early s br Pre dreadnought battleship sea going battleships built to a common design before the launch of dreadnoughts between the mid s to the early s Pre dreadnoughts commonly featured a mixed main battery composed of several different caliber guns br Dreadnought an early th century battleship which set the pattern for all subsequent battleship construction Dreadnoughts differ from pre dreadnoughts in that they feature an all big gun main battery The advantage lies in that if all the big guns have the same characteristics only one firing solution will be needed to aim them all br Fast battleships were battleships which emphasized speed without in concept undue compromise of either armor or armament br Bomb vessels were wooden sailing ships which carried mortars instead of cannons br Coastal defence ship a type of cruiser sized warship built for the purpose of coastal defense br Commerce raider any armed vessel privately or government owned sanctioned to raid a nation s merchant fleet br Merchant raiders are disguised commerce raiders br Corvettes were small ships during the age of sail The concept was revived again in WWII as a merchant convoy escort and anti submarine ship They were only used by the Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy Today they are used for anti submarine warfare and patrolling br Cruiser a fast independent warship Traditionally cruisers were the smallest warships capable of independent action Along with battleships and battlecruisers they have largely vanished from modern navies br Armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late th and early th centuries It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long range independent warship capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered br Scout cruiser was a type of warship of the early th century which were smaller faster more lightly armed and armoured than protected cruisers or light cruisers but larger than contemporary destroyers They were used for scouting br Protected cruiser is a type of naval cruiser of the late th century gained their description because an armored deck offered protection for vital machine spaces from fragments caused by shells exploding above them br Torpedo cruiser is a type of cruiser that is armed primarily with torpedoes br Unprotected cruiser was a type of naval cruiser in use during the early s Victorian or pre dreadnought era br Heavy cruiser was a type of cruiser a naval warship designed for long range and high speed armed generally with naval guns of roughly mm in caliber its parameters were dictated by the Washington Naval Treaty of and the London Naval Treaty of br Pocket battleship br Light cruiser is a type of small or medium sized warship The term is a shortening of the phrase light armored cruiser describing a small ship that carried armor in the same way as an armored cruiser a protective belt and deck br Large cruiser is the class of the battlecruiser sized Alaska class cruisers of the United States Navy during World War II br Guided missile cruisers are cruisers armed anti ship missiles br Aircraft cruiser also known as aviation cruiser or cruiser carrier is a type of warship that combines the features of the aircraft carrier and a surface warship such as a cruiser or battleship br Destroyer a fast and highly maneuverable warship traditionally incapable of independent action Originally developed to counter the threat of torpedo boats they are now the largest independent warship generally seen on the ocean br Guided missile destroyer are destroyers armed with anti ship missiles br Destroyer escort was the United States Navy mid th century classification for a knot km h mph warship designed with the endurance necessary to escort mid ocean convoys of merchant marine ships similar to frigates br East Asian warships br Geobukseon literally Turtle ship were wooden sail and oar propelled Korean warships armed with cannons br Panokseon literally board roofed ship were a type of Korean wooden warships propelled by both sailing and rowing armed with cannons and Hwacha multiple rocket launchers br Atakebune were wooden oar propelled th Century Japanese warships armed with few cannons arquebusiers and archers They were mostly bulky floating fortifications br Mengchong literally Covered Assaulter was a type of leather covered assault warship used in the nd and rd centuries CE in China br Louchuan literally Tower Ship was a type of warship used as a floating fortress in Ancient China The Louchuan was meant to board troops onto enemy ships Although they were also armed with trebuchets for ranged combat br Wugongchuan literally Centipede Ship was a Chinese oared vessel of the th century inspired by the Portuguese galley br Fast attack crafts are a small fast agile offensive often affordable type of warships armed with anti ship missiles guns or torpedoes br Fire ship a vessel of any sort set on fire and sent into an anchorage or fleet with the intention of causing destruction and chaos Exploding fire ships are called hellburners br Frigate originally a medium sized sailing ship Frigates used in modern navies although they date back to the th century are typically used to protect merchant vessels and other warships br Armoured frigate are frigates with armour which was added to ships based on existing frigate and ship of the line designs The additional weight of the armour on these first ironclad warships meant that they could have only one gun deck and they were technically frigates even though they were more powerful than existing ships of the line and occupied the same strategic role br Guided missile frigates are frigates armed with anti ship missiles br Galleass a sailing and rowing warship equally well suited to sailing and rowing br Galleon a th century armed cargo carriers br Hellenistic galleys warships propelled by oars with a sail for use in favorable winds used in the Mediterranean Sea br Bireme an ancient vessel propelled by two banks of oars br Trireme an ancient warship propelled by three banks of oars br Quadrireme an ancient warship invented in Carthage with two levels of oarsmen and was therefore lower than the quinquereme br Quinquereme an ancient warship propelled by three banks of oars On the upper row two rowers hold one oar on the middle row two rowers and on the lower row one man to an oar br Hexareme an ancient warship invented in Syracuse The exact arrangement of the hexareme s oars is unclear If it evolved naturally from the earlier designs it would be a trireme with two rowers per oar br Septireme an ancient warship invented by the Macedonia the septireme was derived by adding a standing rower to the lower level of the hexareme br Octeres very little is known about the octeres at least two of their type were in the fleet of Philip V of Macedon at the Battle of Chios br Enneres a type of warship whose oaring system may have been a modification of the quadrireme with two teams of five and four oarsmen br Deceres a type of warship which is present alongside nines in the fleet of Antigonus I Monophthalmus in BC It is most likely that the ten was derived from adding another oarsman to the nine br Tessarakonteres a very large catamaran galley reportedly built by Ptolemy IV Philopator of Egypt It had seven naval rams with one primary and the deck would have provided a stable platform for catapults that were often mounted on supergalleys However the forty was likely just a showpiece Plutarch describes the ship as for exhibition only br Lembos light warships most commonly associated with the vessels used by the Illyrian tribes chiefly for piracy in the area of Dalmatia Was soon adopted by Macedonia Seleucid Empire Roman Republic and Sparta br Hemiolia light and fast warship that appeared in the early th century BC It was particularly favoured by pirates in the eastern Mediterranean but also used by Alexander the Great as far as the rivers Indus and Jhelum and by the Romans as a troop transport According to one view it was manned by half the number of oarsmen to make room for the soldiers According to another there were one and a half files of oarsmen on each side with the additional half file placed amidships where the hull was wide enough to accommodate them br Trihemiolia this type was classed with the trireme and had two and a half files of oarsmen on each side Judging from the Lindos relief and the famous Nike of Samothrace both of which are thought to represent trihemioliai the two upper files would have been accommodated in an oarbox with the half file located beneath them in the classic thalamitai position of the trireme br Liburna a type of small galley used for raiding and patrols It was originally used by the Liburnians a pirate tribe from Dalmatia and later used by the Roman Navy It had one bench with oars on each side while in the late Roman Republic it was equipped with two banks of oars a bireme remaining faster lighter and more agile than triremes br Gunboats are naval watercraft designed for the express purpose of carrying one or more guns to bombard coastal targets br River gunboat is a type of gunboat for riverine use br Flat iron gunboats were a number of classes of coastal gunboats generally characterized by small size low freeboard the absence of masts and the mounting of a single non traversing large gun aimed by pointing the vessel br Torpedo gunboat were a form of gunboat armed with torpedoes and designed for hunting and destroying smaller torpedo boats br Motor gunboat is a type of a fast gunboat armed with machine guns and autocannons br Grab was a type of ship common on the Malabar Coast in the th and th centuries The ghur b was originally a galley but the type evolved into sailing ships armed with cannons br Gallivat were small armed type of boats with sails and oars armed with swivel guns and used on the Malabar Coast in the th and th centuries br Helicopter carrier an aircraft carrier especially suited to carry helicopters and V STOL aircraft br Ironclad a wooden warship with external iron plating br Casemate ironclad were a type of ironclad gunboats used in the American Civil War br Central battery ship in European continental navies was a development of the high freeboard broadside ironclad of the s br Turret ship was a th century type of warship the earliest to have their guns mounted in a revolving gun turret instead of a broadside arrangement br Floating battery is a kind of armed watercraft often improvised or experimental which carries heavy armament but has few other qualities as a warship br Littoral Combat Ship is a United States Navy classification of warships with the size and role of corvettes br Longship a Viking raiding ship br Maritime Southeast Asian warships br Djong were sailing warships armed with up to a hundred cannons br Kakap were small warships used in Maritime Southeast Asia br Kelulus were

offshore br Missile boats are small fast warship armed with anti ship missiles br Monitor a type of small heavily gunned warships with shallow draft designed for shore bombardment br River monitor a type of monitors used in rivers br Breastwork monitor was a modification of the monitor by Sir Edward Reed of the Royal Navy br Naval trawlers are vessels built along the lines of fishing trawlers but fitted out for naval purposes br Naval drifters are boats built along the lines of a commercial fishing drifter but fitted out for naval purposes br Patrol vessels are relatively small naval vessels generally designed for coastal defence border protection immigration law enforcement search and rescue duties br Penjajap were galley like warships used by several Austronesian ethnic groups in Maritime Southeast Asia armed with Lantaka swivel guns br Q ship also known as Q boats decoy vessels special service ships or mystery ships were heavily armed merchant ships with concealed weaponry designed to lure submarines into making surface attacks This gave Q ships the chance to open fire and sink them br Seaplane tenders were a type of ship used to carry seaplanes into the open sea They are considered by some as the predecessor of the aircraft carrier br Submarine chaser is a small warship used in anti submarine warfare br Ship of the line a sailing warship capable of standing in the line of battle A direct predecessor to the later battleship br Sloop of war was a sailing vessel category later revived in WWII as a convoy escort ship br Screw sloop was a propeller driven sloop of wars used during the mid th Century br Submarine are ships capable of staying submerged for days Modern submarines can stay underwater for months with food supplies as the only limiting factor br

warfare using bow spear and shield wielding warriors During the gunpowder era a single brass or iron cannon was mounted on the bow or stern along with musketeers These warships were used by many tribes and cultures all around the globe br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br History and evolution of warships br br br First warships br br The first evidence of ships being used for warfare comes from Ancient Egypt specifically the northern Nile River most likely to defend against Mediterranean peoples The galley warship most likely originated in Crete an idea which was soon copied and popularized by the Phoenicians In the time of Mesopotamia Ancient Persia Phoenicia Ancient Greece and the Ancient Rome warships were always galleys such as biremes triremes and quinqueremes long narrow vessels powered by banks of oarsmen and designed to ram and sink enemy vessels or to engage them bow first and follow up with boarding parties The development of catapults in the th century BC and the subsequent refinement of this technology enabled the first fleets of siege engine equipped warships by the Hellenistic age During late antiquity ramming fell out of use and the galley tactics against other ships used during the Middle Ages until the late th century focused on boarding br br br br br br br br br br br br The Age of Sail br br Naval artillery was redeveloped in the th century but cannon did not become common at sea until the guns were capable of being reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle The size of a ship required to carry a large number of cannons made oar based propulsion impossible and warships came to rely primarily on sails The sailing man of war emerged during the th century br By the middle of the th century warships were carrying increasing numbers of cannons on their broadsides and tactics evolved to bring each ship s firepower to bear in a line of battle The man of war now evolved into the ship of the line In the th century the frigate and sloop of war too small to stand in the line of battle evolved to escort convoy trade scout for enemy ships and blockade enemy coasts br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Steel steam and shellfire br br During the th century a revolution took place in the means of marine propulsion naval armament and construction of warships Marine steam engines were introduced at first as an auxiliary force in the second quarter of the th century The Crimean War gave a great stimulus to the development of guns The introduction of explosive shells soon led to the introduction of iron and later steel naval armour for the sides and decks of larger warships The first ironclad warships the French Gloire and British Warrior made wooden vessels obsolete Metal soon entirely replaced wood as the main material for warship construction br From the s the sailing ships of the line were replaced by steam powered battleships while the sailing frigates were replaced by steam powered cruisers br The armament of warships also changed with the invention of the rotating barbettes and turrets which allowed the guns to be aimed independently of the direction of the ship and allowed a smaller number of larger guns to be carried br The final innovation during the th century was the development of the torpedo and development of the torpedo boat Small fast torpedo boats seemed to offer an alternative to building expensive fleets of battleships br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Pre dreadnought era br br Pre dreadnought battleships were sea going battleships built between the mid to late s and before the launch of HMS Dreadnought in The pre dreadnought ships replaced the ironclad battleships of the s and s Built from steel protected by case hardened steel armour and powered by coal fired triple expansion steam engines pre dreadnought battleships carried a main battery of very heavy guns in fully enclosed rotating turrets supported by one or more secondary batteries of lighter weapons The role of corvettes sloops and frigates were taken by new types of ships like destroyers protected cruisers and armoured cruisers br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Since br br br The dreadnought era br br Another revolution in capital warship design began shortly after the start of the th century when Britain launched the Royal Navy s all big gun battleship Dreadnought in Powered by steam turbines it was bigger faster and more heavily gunned than any existing battleships which it immediately rendered obsolete It was rapidly followed by similar ships in other countries The Royal Navy also developed the first battlecruisers Mounting the same heavy guns as the dreadnoughts on an even larger hull battlecruisers sacrificed armour protection for speed Battlecruisers were faster and more powerful than all existing cruisers but much more vulnerable to shellfire than contemporary battleships The torpedo boat destroyer was developed at the same time as the dreadnoughts Bigger faster and more heavily gunned than the torpedo boat the destroyer evolved to protect the capital ships from the menace of the torpedo boat br At this time Britain also introduced the use of fuel oil to power steam warships instead of coal Oil produced twice as much power per unit weight as coal and was much easier to handle Tests were conducted by the Royal Navy in involving the torpedo boat destroyer Spiteful the first warship powered solely by fuel oil These proved its superiority and all warships procured for the Royal Navy from were designed to burn fuel oil br br br br br br br br br br br br Obsolescence of battleships br br During the lead up to the Second World War Germany and the United Kingdom once again emerged as the two dominant Atlantic sea powers The German navy under the Treaty of Versailles was limited to only a few minor surface ships But the clever use of deceptive terminology such as Panzerschiffe deceived the British and French commands They were surprised when ships such as Admiral Graf Spee Scharnhorst and Gneisenau raided Allied supply lines The greatest threat however was the introduction of the Kriegsmarine s largest vessels Bismarck and Tirpitz Bismarck was heavily damaged and sunk scuttled after a series of sea battles in the north Atlantic in while Tirpitz was destroyed by the Royal Air Force in The British Royal Navy gained dominance of the European theatre by br br The Second World War brought massive changes in the design and role of several types of warships For the first time the aircraft carrier became the clear choice to serve as the main capital ship within a naval task force World War II was the only war in history in which battles occurred between groups of carriers World War II saw the first use of radar in combat It brought the first naval battle in which the ships of both sides never engaged in direct combat instead sending aircraft to make the attacks as in the Battle of the Coral Sea br br br Cold War era br Modern warships are generally divided into seven main categories which are aircraft carriers cruisers destroyers frigates corvettes submarines and amphibious warfare ships Battleships comprise an eighth category but are not in current service with any navy in the world Only the deactivated American Iowa class battleships still exist as potential combatants and battleships in general are unlikely to re emerge as a ship class without redefinition The destroyer is generally regarded as the dominant surface combat vessel of most modern blue water navies However the once distinct roles and appearances of cruisers destroyers frigates and corvettes have blurred Most vessels have come to be armed with a mix of anti surface anti submarine and anti aircraft weapons Class designations no longer reliably indicate a displacement hierarchy and the size of all vessel types has grown beyond the definitions used earlier in the th century Another key difference between older and modern vessels is that all modern warships are soft without the thick armor and bulging anti torpedo protection of World War II and older designs br Most navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessels such as minesweepers patrol boats and offshore patrol vessels br By the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS treaty negotiations had produced a legal definition of what was then generally accepted as a late twentieth century warship The UNCLOS definition was A warship means a ship belonging to the armed forces of a State bearing the external marks distinguishing such ships of its nationality under the command of an officer duly commissioned by the government of the State and whose name appears in the appropriate service list or its equivalent and manned by a crew which is under regular armed forces discipline br br br Development of the submarine br br The first practical submarines were developed in the late th century but it was only after the development of the torpedo that submarines became truly dangerous and hence useful By the end of the First World War submarines had proved their potential During the Second World War Nazi Germany s fleet of U boats submarines almost starved Britain into submission and inflicted huge losses on US coastal shipping The success of submarines led to the development of new anti submarine convoy escorts during the First and Second World Wars such as the destroyer escort Confusingly many of these new types adopted the names of the smaller warships from the age of sail such as corvette sloop and frigate br br br Development of the aircraft carrier br br A seaplane tender is a ship that supports the operation of seaplanes Some of these vessels known as seaplane carriers could not only carry seaplanes but also provided all the facilities needed for their operation these ships are regarded by some as the first aircraft carriers and appeared just before the First World War br A major shift in naval warfare occurred with the introduction of the aircraft carrier First at Taranto and then at Pearl Harbor the aircraft carrier demonstrated its ability to strike decisively at enemy ships out of sight and range of surface vessels By the end of the Second World War the carrier had become the dominant warship br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Development of the amphibious assault ship br Shinsh Maru was a ship of the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II She was the world s first purpose built landing craft carrier ship and a pioneer of modern day amphibious assault ships During some of her operations she was known to have used at least four cover names R GL MT and Ryujo Maru br An amphibious warfare ship is an amphibious vehicle warship employed to land and support ground forces such as marines on enemy territory during an amphibious assault br Specialized shipping can be divided into two types most crudely described as ships and craft In general the ships carry the troops from the port of embarkation to the drop point for the assault and the craft carry the troops from the ship to the shore Amphibious assaults taking place over short distances can also involve the shore to shore technique where landing craft go directly from the port of embarkation to the assault point Amphibious assault ships have a well deck with landing craft which can carry tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles and also have a deck like a helicopter carrier for helicopters and V STOL aircraft br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br List of
