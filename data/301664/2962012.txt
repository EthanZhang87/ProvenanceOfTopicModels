The Severn class is the largest lifeboat operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution RNLI The class which is metres ft in long was introduced in to service in It is named after the River Severn the longest river in Great Britain The lifeboats are stationed at locations around the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland and can provide coverage up to nmi km out to sea br br br History br In the s the RNLI s fast Arun and Waveney all weather lifeboats provided coverage miles km out to sea operating at up to knots km h mph to cover the distance in two hours in good weather However the RNLI felt that they needed the capability to extend their coverage to miles km radius which would require lifeboats with a top speed of knots km h mph This resulted in the metre ft Severn and metre ft Trent lifeboats br The prototype Severn was launched in ON and was named Maurice and Joyce Hardy Trials started the following year and lasted until In the boat was de named Problems were encountered during the trials with the skegs that protected the propellers but were designed to protect the hull by breaking off if the boat hit rocks as the first ones were too easily broken Crashing through heavy seas at full speed caused damage to the hull too It was transferred to training work when it carried operational number TL and was named Peter and Marion Fulton but was withdrawn in It was sold in in it was in use as a dive boat at Buckie carrying the name Gemini Storm Sold to Montrose Marine Services ltd in and renamed Eileen May Sold into private ownership based North Wales coast br The first production Severn was The Will It had been built in by Berthon Boat Co Builders of of the Severn class lifeboats for Stornoway but had to undergo several modifications before it was fit for service It was eventually placed in the relief fleet in and shown to many lifeboat stations where the class was expected to be deployed It so impressed the crew at Falmouth that they pressed the RNLI to station it there until their own boat was built and so it was stationed there from January until December when it was replaced by Richard Scott Cox In the meantime Tom Sanderson had been deployed at Stornoway in The Will returned to the relief fleet after its time at Falmouth until when it was the first Severn Class to undergo the Severn Life Extension Programme Construction of its sister boats continued until br In the Canadian Coast Guard commissioned a version of the Severn class modified for extreme conditions found off the coast of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia br br br Description br Severns are constructed of fibre reinforced composite material and their hard chine semi displacement hull is built so that it will stay afloat with two of its five compartments flooded For added manoeuvrability in addition to twin engines the Severn also has a bow thruster fitted The propellers are enclosed so that the Severn can take ground without damaging them A Y class inflatable boat can be deployed by an on board crane for use in shallow water or confined spaces br Severns have comprehensive electronics systems that include full MF and VHF DSC radio equipment differential GPS navigator an electronic chart system VHF radio direction finder radar and weather sensors Provision for survivors includes comprehensive first aid equipment including stretchers oxygen and Entonox They carry a portable salvage pump in a water tight container and can also carry out pumping and fire fighting tasks using the engine driven general service pump br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Fleet br br br Severn Life Extension Programme br In the RNLI started to design a Severn Life Extension Programme SLEP with the intention of extending the fleet s lifespan by years It involves taking an existing boat and fully refitting it from the hull up The addition of modern electronic systems and shock mitigating seats similar to those found on the Shannon class lifeboats are among many upgrades In July it was announced that the prototype was almost complete and would soon be ready for sea trials br br br Fleet br br br br br br External links br br RNLI Fleet Severn Class
