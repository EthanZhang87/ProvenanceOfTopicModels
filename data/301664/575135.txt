A submersible is an underwater vehicle which needs to be transported and supported by a larger watercraft or platform This distinguishes submersibles from submarines which are self supporting and capable of prolonged independent operation at sea br There are many types of submersibles including both human occupied vehicles HOVs and uncrewed craft variously known as remotely operated vehicles ROVs or unmanned underwater vehicles UUVs Submersibles have many uses including oceanography underwater archaeology ocean exploration tourism equipment maintenance and recovery and underwater videography br br br History br br The first recorded self propelled underwater vessel was a small oar powered submarine conceived by William Bourne c and designed and built by Dutch inventor Cornelis Drebbel in with two more improved versions built in the following four years Contemporary accounts state that the final model was demonstrated to King James I in person who may even have been taken aboard for a test dive There do not appear to have been any further recorded submersibles until Bushnell s Turtle br The first submersible to be used in war was designed and built by American inventor David Bushnell in as a means to attach explosive charges to enemy ships during the American Revolutionary War The device dubbed Bushnell s Turtle was an oval shaped vessel of wood and brass It had tanks that were filled with water to make it dive and then emptied with the help of a hand pump to make it return to the surface The operator used two hand cranked propellers to move vertically or laterally under the water The vehicle had small glass windows on top and naturally luminescent wood affixed to its instruments so that they could be read in the dark br Bushnell s Turtle was first set into action on September at New York Harbor to attack the British flagship HMS Eagle Sergeant Ezra Lee operated the vehicle at that time Lee successfully brought Turtle against the underside of Eagle s hull but failed to attach the charge because of the strong water currents br br br Operation br Apart from size the main technical difference between a submersible and a submarine is that submersibles are not fully autonomous and may rely on a support facility or vessel for replenishment of power and breathing gases Submersibles typically have shorter range and operate primarily underwater as most have little function at the surface Some submersibles operate on a tether or umbilical remaining connected to a tender a submarine surface vessel or platform Submersibles have been able to dive to over km ft below the surface br Submersibles may be relatively small hold only a small crew and have no living facilities br A submersible often has very dexterous mobility provided by propeller screws or pump jets br br br Technologies br br Different basic technologies used in the design of submersibles br br br Atmospheric pressure br The Earth s atmosphere exerts a pressure on its surface similar to how water exerts pressure due to its weight Unlike water however the atmosphere is compressible because it is composed of gases Consequently the density of the atmosphere varies with height with highest density at sea level As a result the maximum atmospheric pressure is experienced at sea level gradually decreasing with increasing altitude br To calculate atmospheric pressure we consider the pressure exerted by a column of seawater meters in height Under average condition the atmosphere can support such a column resulting in an atmospheric pressure of Newtons per square meter N m br Gauge pressure and absolute pressure br When measuring gas pressures including those experienced underwater gauge pressure and absolute pressure are essential concepts br Gauge pressure A pressure gauge is typically calibrated to read zero when the gauge is at atmospheric pressure This gauge records only the difference of pressure between the measured pressure and atmospheric pressure If such a gauge is used underwater it will indicate only the additional pressure exerted by the water For example if the gauge reads bar the measured pressure is actually bar above atmospheric pressure equivalent to bar relative to vacuum br Absolute pressure At sea level the atmosphere exerts a pressure of approximately bar or N m Underwater the pressure increases by approximately bar for every metre of depth The total pressure at any given depth is the sum of the pressure of the water at that depth hydrostatic pressure and atmospheric pressure This combined pressure is known as absolute pressure and the relationship is br Absolute pressure bar abs gauge pressure bar atmospheric pressure about bar br To calculate absolute pressure add the atmospheric pressure to the gauge pressure using the same unit Working with depth rather than pressure may be convenient in diving calculations In this context atmospheric pressure is considered equivalent to a depth of meters br Absolute depth m gauge depth m m br Depth measurement Pressure monitoring devices br The pressure the is more important for structural and physiological reasons than linear depth Pressure at a given depth may vary due to variations in water density br To express the linear depth in water accurately the measurement should be in meters m The unit meters of sea water msw is a by definition a unit for measurement of pressure br Note A change in depth of meters for a change in pressure of bar equates to a water density of kg m br Single atmosphere submersibles have a pressure hull with internal pressure maintained at surface atmospheric pressure This requires the hull to be capable of withstanding the ambient hydrostatic pressure from the water outside which can be many times greater than the internal pressure br Ambient pressure submersibles maintain the same pressure both inside and outside the vessel The interior is air filled at a pressure to balance the external pressure so the hull does not have to withstand a pressure difference br A third technology is the wet sub which refers to a vehicle that may or may not be enclosed but in either case water floods the interior so underwater breathing equipment is used by the crew This may be scuba carried by the divers or a breathing gas supply carried by the vessel br br br Buoyancy br br When an object is immersed in a liquid it displaces the liquid pushing it out of the way br Once the object is partially immersed pressure forces exerted on the immersed parts are equal to the weight of water displaced Consequently objects submerged in liquids appear to weigh less due to this buoyant force The relationship between the amount of liquid displaced and the resulting up thrust is known as Archimedes principle which states br when an object is wholly or partially immersed in a liquid the up thrust it receives is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced br Buoyancy and weight determine whether an object floats or sinks in a liquid The relative magnitudes of weight and buoyancy determine the outcome leading to three possible scenarios br Negative Buoyancy when the weight of an object is greater than the up thrust it experiences due to the weight of the liquid displaced the object sinks br Neutral Buoyancy if the weight of an object equals the up thrust the object remains stable in its current position neither sinking or floating br Positive Buoyancy when the weight of an object is less than the up thrust the object rises and floats As it reaches the liquid s surface It partly emerges from the liquid reducing the weight of the displaced liquid and consequently the up thrust Eventually the reduced up thrust balances the weight of the object allowing it to float in a state of equilibrium br br br Buoyancy control br During underwater operation a submersible will generally be neutrally buoyant but may use positive or negative buoyancy to facilitate vertical motion Negative buoyancy may also be useful at times to settle the vessel on the bottom and positive buoyancy is necessary to float the vessel at the surface Fine buoyancy adjustments may be made using one or more variable buoyancy pressure vessels as trim tanks and gross changes of buoyancy at or near the surface may use ambient pressure ballast tanks which are fully flooded during underwater operations Some submersibles use high density external ballast which may be released at depth in an emergency to make the vessel sufficiently buoyant to float back to the surface even if all power is lost or to travel faster vertically br br br Deep diving crewed submersibles br br Some submersibles have been able to dive to great depths The bathyscaphe Trieste was the first to reach the deepest part of the ocean nearly km ft below the surface at the bottom of the Mariana Trench in br China with its Jiaolong project in was the fifth country to send a person meters below sea level following the US France Russia and Japan On June the Jiaolong submersible set a deep diving record for state owned vessels when the three person sub descended meters ft into the Pacific Ocean br Among the most well known and longest in operation submersibles is the deep submergence research vessel DSV Alvin which takes people to depths of up to metres ft Alvin is owned by the United States Navy and operated by WHOI and as of had made over dives br James Cameron made a record setting crewed submersible dive to the bottom of Challenger Deep the deepest known point of the Mariana Trench on March Cameron s submersible was named Deepsea Challenger and reached a depth of metres ft br br br Commercial submersibles br Private firms such as Triton Submarines LLC SEAmagine Hydrospace Sub Aviator Systems or SAS and Netherlands based U boat Worx have developed small submersibles for tourism exploration and adventure travel A Canadian company in British Columbia called Sportsub has been building personal recreational submersibles since with open floor designs partially flooded cockpits br A privately owned U S company OceanGate also participated in building submersibles though the company fell under scrutiny when their newest submersible imploded underwater with no survivors br br br Marine remotely operated vehicles br br Small uncrewed submersibles called marine remotely operated vehicles MROVs or remotely operated underwater vehicles ROUVs are widely used to work in water too deep or too dangerous for divers or when it is economically advantageous br Remotely operated vehicles ROVs repair offshore oil platforms and attach cables to sunken ships to hoist them Such remotely operated vehicles are attached by an umbilical cable a thick cable providing power and communications to a control center on a ship Operators on the ship see video and or sonar images sent back from the ROV and remotely control its thrusters and manipulator arm The wreck of the Titanic was explored by such a vehicle as well as by a crewed vessel br br br Autonomous underwater vehicles br br br Diver lock out submersible br Class of submersible which has an airlock and an integral diving chamber from which
