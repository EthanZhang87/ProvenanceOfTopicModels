Dorset DOR sit archaically Dorsetshire DOR sit sheer sh r is a ceremonial county in South West England It is bordered by Somerset to the north west Wiltshire to the north and the north east Hampshire to the east the Isle of Wight across the Solent to the south east the English Channel to the south and Devon to the west The largest settlement is Bournemouth and the county town is Dorchester br The county has an area of km sq mi and a population of Around half of the population lives in the South East Dorset conurbation which contains three of the county s largest settlements Bournemouth Poole and Christchurch The remainder of the county is largely rural and its principal towns are Weymouth and Dorchester Dorset contains two unitary authority areas Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole and Dorset The county did not historically include Bournemouth and Christchurch which were part of Hampshire br Dorset has a varied landscape of chalk downs steep limestone ridges and low lying clay valleys The majority of its coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance and features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove the Isle of Portland Chesil Beach and Durdle Door The north of the county contains part of Cranbourne Chase a chalk downland The highest point in Dorset is Lewesdon Hill m ft in the southwest br There is evidence of Neolithic Celtic and Roman settlement in Dorset and during the Early Middle Ages the region was settled by the Saxons the county developed in the th century The first recorded Viking raid on the British Isles occurred in Dorset during the eighth century and the Black Death entered England at Melcombe Regis in The county has seen much civil unrest in the English Civil War an uprising of vigilantes was crushed by Oliver Cromwell s forces in a pitched battle near Shaftesbury the doomed Monmouth Rebellion began at Lyme Regis and a group of farm labourers from Tolpuddle were instrumental in the formation of the trade union movement During the Second World War Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy and the large harbours of Portland and Poole were two of the main embarkation points Agriculture was historically the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline in favour of tourism br br br Toponymy br Dorset derives its name from the county town of Dorchester The Romans established the settlement in the st century and named it Durnovaria which was a Latinised version of a Common Brittonic word possibly meaning place with fist sized pebbles The Saxons named the town Dornwaraceaster the suffix ceaster being the Old English name for a Roman town cf Exeter and Gloucester and Dorns te came into use as the name for the inhabitants of the area from Dorn a reduced form of Dornwaraceaster and the Old English word s te meaning people It is first mentioned in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle in AD and in the th century the county s archaic name Dorseteschyre Dorsetshire was first recorded br br br History br br br Early history br The first human visitors to Dorset were Mesolithic hunters from around BC The first permanent Neolithic settlers appeared around BC and were responsible for the creation of the Dorset Cursus a kilometre mi monument for ritual or ceremonial purposes From BC onwards Bronze Age farmers cleared Dorset s woodlands for agricultural use and Dorset s high chalk hills provided a location for numerous round barrows During the Iron Age the British tribe known as the Durotriges established a series of hill forts across the county most notably Maiden Castle which is one of the largest in Europe br The Romans arrived in Dorset during their conquest of Britain in AD Maiden Castle was captured by a Roman legion under the command of Vespasian and the Roman settlement of Durnovaria was established nearby Bokerley Dyke a large defensive ditch built by the county s post Roman inhabitants near the border with modern day Hampshire delayed the advance of the Saxons into Dorset for almost years It appears to have been re fortified during this period with the former Roman Road at Ackling Dyke also being blocked by the Britons apparently to prevent the West Saxon advance into Dorset br However by the end of the th century Dorset had fallen under Saxon control and been incorporated into the Kingdom of Wessex The precise details of this West Saxon conquest and how it took place are not clear but it appears to have substantially taken place by the start of the reign of Caedwalla in The Saxons established a diocese at Sherborne and Dorset was made a shire an administrative district of Wessex and predecessor to the English county system with borders that have changed little since In the first recorded Viking attack on the British Isles took place in Dorset on the Portland coast and they continued to raid into the county for the next two centuries br After the Norman Conquest in feudal rule was established in Dorset and the bulk of the land was divided between the Crown and ecclesiastical institutions The Normans consolidated their control over the area by constructing castles at Corfe Wareham and Dorchester in the early part of the th century Over the next years Dorset s population grew substantially and additional land was enclosed for farming to provide the extra food required The wool trade the quarrying of Purbeck Marble and the busy ports of Weymouth Melcombe Regis Lyme Regis and Bridport brought prosperity to the county However Dorset was devastated by the bubonic plague in which arrived in Melcombe Regis on a ship from Gascony The disease more commonly known as the Black Death created an epidemic that spread rapidly and wiped out a third of the population of the country Dorset came under the political influence of a number of different nobles during the Middle Ages During the Wars of the Roses for instance Dorset came into the area influenced by Humphrey Stafford earl of Devon originally of Hooke Dorset whose wider influence stretched from Cornwall to Wiltshire After one of the most influential Dorset figures was Henry VII s chamberlain Giles Daubeney br br br Modern history br br The dissolution of the monasteries met little resistance in Dorset and many of the county s abbeys including Shaftesbury Cerne and Milton were sold to private owners In at the commencement of the English Civil War the Royalists took control of the entire county apart from Poole and Lyme Regis However within three years their gains had been almost entirely reversed by the Parliamentarians An uprising of Clubmen vigilantes weary of the depredations of the war took place in Dorset in Some of these rebels offered battle to Lord Fairfax s Parliamentary army at Hambledon Hill but they were easily routed Sherborne Castle was taken by Fairfax that same year and in Corfe Castle the last remaining Royalist stronghold in Dorset was captured after an act of betrayal both were subsequently slighted The Duke of Monmouth s unsuccessful attempt to overthrow James II began when he landed at Lyme Regis in A series of trials known as the Bloody Assizes took place to punish the rebels Over a five day period in Dorchester Judge Jeffreys presided over cases of the accused were executed were transported and nine were publicly whipped In at Charborough Park a meeting took place to plot the downfall of James II of England This meeting was effectively the start of the Glorious Revolution br During the th century much smuggling took place along the Dorset coast its coves caves and sandy beaches provided opportunities for gangs such as the Hawkhursts to stealthily bring smuggled goods ashore Poole became Dorset s busiest port and established prosperous trade links with the fisheries of Newfoundland which supported cloth rope and net manufacturing industries in the surrounding towns and villages However the industrial revolution largely bypassed Dorset which lacked coal resources and as a consequence the county remained predominantly agricultural Farming has always been central to the economy of Dorset and the county became the birthplace of the modern trade union movement when in six farm labourers formed a union to protest against falling wages The labourers who are now known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs were subsequently arrested for administering unlawful oaths and sentenced to transportation but they were pardoned following massive protests by the working classes br The Dorsetshire Regiment were the first British unit to face a gas attack during the First World War and they sustained particularly heavy losses at the Battle of the Somme In total some Dorset servicemen died in the war and of the county s towns and villages only one Langton Herring known as a Thankful Village had no residents killed During the Second World War Dorset was heavily involved in the preparations for the invasion of Normandy beach landing exercises were carried out at Studland and Weymouth and the village of Tyneham was requisitioned for army training Tens of thousands of troops departed Weymouth Portland and Poole harbours during D Day and gliders from RAF Tarrant Rushton dropped troops near Caen to begin Operation Tonga br Dorset experienced an increase in holiday makers after the war First popularised as a tourist destination by George III s frequent visits to Weymouth the county s coastline seaside resorts and its sparsely populated rural areas attract millions of visitors each year With farming declining across the country tourism has edged ahead as the primary revenue earning sector br br br Settlements br br Dorset is largely rural with many small villages few large towns and no cities The only major urban area is the South East Dorset conurbation which is situated at the south eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth the historic port and borough of Poole the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages Bournemouth the most populous town in the conurbation was established in the Georgian era when sea bathing became popular Poole the second largest settlement once the largest town in the county adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has some of the highest land values by area in the world br The other two major settlements in the county are Dorchester which has been the county town since at least and Weymouth a major seaside resort since the th century Blandford Forum Sherborne Gillingham Shaftesbury and Sturminster Newton are historic market towns which serve the farms and villages of the Blackmore Vale in north Dorset Beaminster and Bridport are situated in the west of the county Verwood and the historic Saxon market towns of Wareham and Wimborne Minster are located to the east Lyme Regis and Swanage are small coastal towns popular with tourists Under construction on the western edge of Dorchester is the experimental new town of Poundbury commissioned and co designed by Prince Charles The suburb which is expected to be fully completed by was designed to integrate residential and retail buildings and counter the growth of dormitory towns and car oriented development br br br Physical geography br br Dorset covers an area of square kilometres sq mi and contains considerable variety in its underlying geology which is partly responsible for the diversity of landscape A large percentage of the county comprises either chalk clay or mixed sand and gravels The remainder is less straightforward and includes Portland and Purbeck stone other limestones calcareous clays and shales Portland and Purbeck stone are of national importance as a building material and for restoring some of Britain s most famous landmarks Almost every type of rock known from the Early Jurassic to the Eocene epochs can be found in the county br br Dorset has a number of limestone ridges which are mostly covered in either arable fields or calcareous grassland supporting sheep These limestone areas include a wide band of Cretaceous chalk which crosses the county as a range of hills from north east to south west incorporating Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs and a narrow band running from south west to south east incorporating the Purbeck Hills Between the chalk hills are large wide vales and wide flood plains These vales are dotted with small villages farms and coppices and include the Blackmore Vale Stour valley and the Frome valley The Blackmore Vale is composed of older Jurassic deposits largely clays interspersed with limestones and has traditionally been a centre for dairy agriculture South east Dorset including the lower Frome valley and around Poole and Bournemouth comprises younger Eocene deposits mainly sands and clays of poor agricultural quality The soils created from these deposits support a heathland habitat which sustains all six native British reptile species Most of the Dorset heathland has Site of Special Scientific Interest status with three areas designated as internationally important Ramsar sites In the far west of the county and along the coast there are frequent changes in rock strata which appear in a less obviously sequential way compared to the landscapes of the chalk and the heath In the west this results in a hilly landscape of diverse character that resembles that of neighbouring county Devon Marshwood Vale a valley of Lower Lias clay at the western tip of the county lies to the south of the two highest points in Dorset Lewesdon Hill at metres ft and Pilsdon Pen at metres ft br A former river valley flooded by rising sea levels years ago Poole Harbour is one of the largest natural harbours in the world br The harbour is very shallow in places and contains a number of islands notably Brownsea Island the birthplace of the Scouting movement and one of the few remaining sanctuaries for indigenous red squirrels in England The harbour and the chalk and limestone hills of the Isle of Purbeck to the south lie atop Western Europe s largest onshore oil field The field operated by Perenco from Wytch Farm has the world s oldest continuously pumping well at Kimmeridge which has been producing oil since the early s br br Dorset s diverse geography ensures it has an assortment of rivers although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills means most are typically lowland in nature Much of the county drains into three rivers the Frome Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south easterly direction The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour which rises in Wiltshire to the north has its origins in clay soil The River Avon which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire enters Dorset towards the end of its journey at Christchurch Harbour The rivers Axe and Yeo which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively have their sources in the north west of the county In the south west a number of small rivers run into the sea along the Dorset coastline most notable of these are the Char Brit Bride and Wey br Most of Dorset s coastline is part of the Jurassic Coast a World Heritage Site which stretches for kilometres mi between Studland and Exmouth in Devon This coast documents the entire Mesozoic era from Triassic to Cretaceous and is noted for its geological landforms The Dorset section has yielded important fossils including Jurassic trees and the first complete Ichthyosaur discovered near Lyme Regis in by Mary Anning The county features some notable coastal landforms including examples of a cove Lulworth Cove a natural arch Durdle Door and chalk stacks Old Harry Rocks Jutting out into the English Channel at roughly the midpoint of the Dorset coastline is the Isle of Portland a limestone island that is connected to the mainland by Chesil Beach a kilometre mi long shingle barrier beach protecting Britain s largest tidal lagoon br The county has one of the highest proportions of conservation areas in England and two Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty AONBs cover of the administrative county It has two heritage coasts totalling kilometres mi and Sites of Special Scientific Interest covering km sq mi The South West Coast Path a National Trail begins at South Haven Point at the entrance to Poole Harbour There are also substantial areas of green belt surrounding the South East Dorset conurbation filling in the area between this and the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs AONB br br br Climate br br Dorset s climate of warm summers and mild winters is partly due to its position on Britain s south coast The third most southerly county in the UK Dorset is less affected by the more intense Atlantic winds than Cornwall and Devon Dorset along with the entire south west has higher winter temperatures average to C to F than the rest of the United Kingdom However Dorset maintains higher summer temperatures than Devon and Cornwall with average highs of to C to F Excluding hills such as the Dorset Downs the average annual temperature of the county is to C to F br The south coast counties of Dorset Hampshire West Sussex East Sussex and Kent enjoy more sunshine than anywhere else in the United Kingdom receiving hours a year Average annual rainfall varies across the county southern and eastern coastal areas receive mm in per year the Dorset Downs receive between and mm in per year less than much of Devon and Cornwall to the west but more than counties to the east br br br Demography br br The Census records Dorset s population as This consisted of for the non metropolitan county not including Bournemouth and Poole for the unitary authority of Bournemouth and for the unitary authority of Poole In it was estimated that the population had risen by around to in the non metropolitan county and and in Bournemouth and Poole respectively More than half of the county s residents live in the Bournemouth Poole and Christchurch conurbation br Dorset s population has a high proportion of older people and a lower than average proportion of young people According to mid year estimates are over years of age higher than the England and Wales average of and are less than years old lower than the England and Wales average of The working age population females and males between and is lower than England and Wales average compared to Data collected between and shows that average life expectancy at birth in the county is years for females and years for males This compares favourably with the averages for England and Wales of and years respectively Around of Dorset s population are of white ethnicity of the population are Christian and say they are not religious br More than of the county s population possess a level qualification or above such as a Higher National Diploma Degree or a

secretaries group around have a skilled trade group over are employed at a low level in the care leisure sales or customer relations sector groups and and are operatives or in elementary occupations groups and br br br Politics br br br Local government br Local government in Dorset consists of two unitary authorities UA Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole BCP Council which governs the major conurbation comprising the three towns and Dorset Council which serves the more rural remainder of the county For the BCP council voters choose councillors from wards with ten wards returning three candidates apiece and wards two Dorset elects councillors representing six three councillor wards two councillor wards and single councillor wards wards in total In both authorities elections for the entire council occur every four years br The two authorities came into existence on April when Bournemouth and Poole merged with Christchurch one of six second tier districts previously governed by Dorset County Council leaving the other five districts Weymouth and Portland West Dorset North Dorset Purbeck and East Dorset to form a second UA br Dorset County Council was first formed in by an act of government to govern the newly created administrative county of Dorset which had been based largely on the historic county borders Dorset became a two tier non metropolitan county after a reorganisation of local government in and its border was extended eastwards to incorporate the former Hampshire towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch Following a review by the Local Government Commission for England Bournemouth and Poole each became administratively independent single tier unitary authorities in br br br National representation br br For representation in Parliament Dorset is divided into eight Parliamentary constituencies five county constituencies and three borough constituencies At the general election the Conservative Party was dominant taking all eight seats The borough constituencies of Bournemouth East Bournemouth West and Poole are traditionally Conservative safe seats and are all represented by Conservative members of parliament The county constituencies of North Dorset and Christchurch are also represented by Conservative MPs Between and West Dorset was represented by Conservative MP Oliver Letwin who was the Minister of State at the Cabinet Office in David Cameron s government The seat was won by Chris Loder in the general election br The marginal seat of South Dorset is represented by Richard Drax who gained the seat from Labour representative Jim Knight in Drax retained the seat in and The Mid Dorset and North Poole constituency has been represented by the Conservative MP Michael Tomlinson since br In the general election the Conservatives held all eight constituencies in Dorset br br br Economy and industry br br In the gross value added GVA for the non metropolitan county was million with an additional million for Poole and Bournemouth The primary sector produced of GVA the secondary sector produced and came from the tertiary sector The average GVA for the regions of South West England was million br The principal industry in Dorset was once agriculture It has not however been the largest employer since the mid th century as mechanisation substantially reduced the number of workers required Agriculture has become less profitable and the industry has declined further Within the administrative county between and GVA for primary industry largely agriculture fishing and quarrying declined from million to million to In km sq mi of the county was in agricultural use up from km sq mi in although this was due to an increase in permanent grass and land set aside By contrast in the same period arable land decreased from to km to sq mi Excluding fowl sheep are the most common animal stock in the county between and their numbers fell from to Cattle and pig farming has declined similarly during the same period the number of cattle fell from to and pigs from to br In there were armed forces personnel stationed in Dorset including the Royal Armoured Corps at Bovington Royal Signals at Blandford and the Royal Marines at Poole The military presence has had a mixed effect on the local economy bringing additional employment for civilians but on occasion having a negative impact on the tourist trade particularly when popular areas are closed for military manoeuvres br Other major employers in the county include BAE Systems Sunseeker International J P Morgan Cobham plc and Bournemouth University Dorset s three ports Poole Weymouth and Portland and the smaller harbours of Christchurch Swanage Lyme Regis Wareham and West Bay generate a substantial amount of international trade and tourism Around fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset s ports When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the Summer Olympic Games the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector It is expected that this will continue to have a positive effect on local businesses and tourism br br Tourism has grown in Dorset since the late th century and is now the predominant industry It is estimated that people work in Dorset s tourism sector Some million British and foreign tourists visited the county in staying a total of million nights In addition there were million day visitors The combined spending of both groups was million Towns received of Dorset s day trippers went to the coast and to the countryside A survey carried out in concluded that the primary reason tourists were drawn to Dorset was the attractiveness of the county s coast and countryside Numbers of domestic and foreign tourists have fluctuated in recent years due to various factors including security and economic downturn a trend reflected throughout the UK br Manufacturing industry in Dorset provided of employment in This was slightly above the average for Great Britain but below that of the South West region which was at for that period The sector is the county s fourth largest employer but a predicted decline suggests there will be fewer jobs in manufacturing by br br br Culture br br As a largely rural county Dorset has fewer major cultural institutions than larger or more densely populated areas Major venues for concerts and theatre include the Lighthouse arts centre in Poole the Bournemouth International Centre Pavilion Theatre and O Academy in Bournemouth and the Pavilion theatre in Weymouth The Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra founded in is based in Poole br Dorset has more than general and specialist museums The Dorset County Museum now the Dorset Museum in Dorchester was founded in and contains an extensive collection of exhibits covering the county s history and environment The Tank Museum at Bovington contains more than tanks and armoured vehicles from nations

of England Main Line runs through the north of the county at Gillingham and Sherborne Running west from London Waterloo to Exeter St Davids in Devon it provides a service for those who live in the western districts of Dorset The South West Main Line runs through the south at Bournemouth Poole Dorchester and the terminus at Weymouth Additionally the Heart of Wessex Line runs north from Weymouth to Bristol and the Swanage Railway a heritage steam and diesel railway runs the kilometres mi between Norden and Swanage br Dorset is one of few English counties not well served by canals and has no motorways The A A and A trunk roads run through the county The A which connects the West Country to London via the M clips the north west of the county The A crosses the county in a west east direction from Honiton in Devon via Bridport Dorchester Poole Bournemouth and Christchurch to Southampton in Hampshire The A connects to the A at Bere Regis and passes east through Wimborne and Ferndown to Hampshire where it later becomes the M Other main roads in the county include the A A A and A The A heads north from Bournemouth to Ringwood Hampshire and on to Salisbury Wiltshire and beyond The A also connects to Salisbury after travelling north east from Weymouth in the south of the county The A travels north west from Dorchester to Yeovil in Somerset The A also leads north from

frequent services linking major towns including Bournemouth Poole and Wimborne and a varied service in further rural locations The First Group operate buses in the Weymouth and Bridport area including a regular route along the A from Weymouth to Axminster which helps to compensate for the missing rail link west of Dorchester and the Jurassic Coaster service which runs along the county s coastline Yellow Buses provided bus services within Bournemouth and outlying areas until they ceased operating in br br br Religious sites br br Unlike all of its neighbouring counties Dorset does not have a cathedral Over of the county falls within the Church of England Diocese of Salisbury A small section to the west comes under the Diocese of Bath and Wells and to the east Christchurch and much of Bournemouth both historically part of Hampshire belong to the Diocese of Winchester The Roman Catholic Diocese of Plymouth incorporates most of Dorset with the exception of Christchurch and a portion of Bournemouth which belongs to the Diocese of Portsmouth Few purpose built places of worship exist in Dorset for faiths other than Christianity In a Hindu temple was constructed in Blandford Forum for the Gurkhas based at the town s military camp Bournemouth which contains a higher proportion of Jewish residents than the national average has three synagogues and an Islamic Centre and a mosque for Muslims br Christianity was introduced to Dorset by the Romans A th century Roman mosaic discovered near Hinton St Mary contains what is generally accepted to be an image of Christ Christianity

Wimborne Minster features a chained library and a th century astronomical clock Christchurch Priory is renowned for its miraculous beam which according to legend was installed by Christ and the th century roof spanning the nave at St John the Baptist Church in Bere Regis is described by architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner as the finest timber roof of Dorset St Candida and Holy Cross at Whitchurch Canonicorum is the only church in the country besides Westminster Abbey to have a shrine that contains the relics of a saint br Monastic foundations were once abundant in Dorset but all ceased to exist at the Dissolution of the monasteries The Reformation and the political and religious turmoil that ensued largely checked the building of new churches until the turn of the th century Notable examples of Early Georgian churches include the Bastard brothers Church of St Peter and St Paul in Blandford Forum and St George s Church on the Isle of Portland which has a steeple and tower inspired by the works of Christopher Wren From the late th century onwards churches in Dorset tended towards a Gothic Revival style A notable exception to this trend however is the Church of St Mary

had replaced every window by br br br Education br br Responsibility for state schools in Dorset is divided between two local education authorities Dorset Council which covers the majority of the county and Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole BCP Council Most of the Dorset Council area operates a two tier comprehensive system whereby pupils attend a primary school before completing their education at secondary school but Corfe Mullen Dorchester Ferndown and West Moors maintain a three tier system first middle and high school Bournemouth operates a two tier system Poole operates two and three tier systems BCP is one of the few local authorities in England to maintain selective education containing four single sex grammar schools which select pupils on the basis of an eleven plus examination Some of the county s schools are academies self governing state schools which have become independent of their local education authority and are maintained directly by the Department for Education In the Progress score for schools in the Dorset Council area was ranked below average and of pupils gained at least Grade or above in English and maths GCSEs matching the national average of Poole recorded an above average Progress score and of pupils achieved Grade or above in English and maths GCSEs Bournemouth was ranked as average and of pupils achieved Grade or above in English and maths GCSEs br Dorset contains a range of privately funded independent schools Many are boarding schools which also take day pupils such as the co educational Canford School which is built around a th century Grade I listed manor house and Sherborne School a boys school founded in the th century br Four of the county s five largest towns contain a further education college Weymouth College Kingston Maurward College in Dorchester and Bournemouth and Poole College which is one of the largest in the UK Dorset has two higher education establishments situated in the heart of the county s south east conurbation Bournemouth University has facilities across Bournemouth and Poole and over students Previously named Bournemouth Polytechnic it was granted university status as a result of the Further
