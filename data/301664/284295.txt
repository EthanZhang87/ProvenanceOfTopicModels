Poole Harbour is a large natural harbour in Dorset southern England with the town of Poole on its shores The harbour is a drowned valley ria formed at the end of the last ice age and is the estuary of several rivers the largest being the Frome The harbour has a long history of human settlement stretching to pre Roman times The harbour is extremely shallow average depth cm in with one main dredged channel through the harbour from the mouth to Holes Bay br Poole Harbour has an area of approximately km sq mi It is one of several which lay claim to the title of second largest natural harbour in the world after Port Jackson Sydney br br br History br br In during harbour dredging the waterlogged remains of a year old Iron Age logboat were found off Brownsea Island Dated at about BC the metres ft Poole Logboat is one of the largest vessels of its type from British waters Its low freeboard would have limited its use to within Poole Harbour br Poole was used by the Romans as an invasion port for the conquest of southern England who established the settlement at Hamworthy now the western half of Poole A Roman Road ran north from Hamworthy to Badbury Rings a Roman transport hub At the time of the Norman Conquest Poole was a small fishing village br The port grew and in Poole was made Dorset s Port of the Staple for the export of wool Medieval Poole had trading links from the Baltics to Italy In the th century the town began trading with North America in particular Newfoundland and the town became very wealthy In the th century Poole was the principal British port trading with North America At the start of the th century of Poole s population s employment was directly dependent on the harbour but this dropped to during the century as the railways reached the town and deep hulled boats moved up the coast to Southampton which had a deeper harbour and is closer to London With regular dredging of a channel through the harbour it has regained some importance br During WW Poole Harbour hosted seaplane bases br Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office was decided in br The longest ship to enter the harbour is DFDS LD Lines metre Norman Voyager on October with the second longest being the metre Armorique of Brittany Ferries which arrived in the port for the first time on February The previous holder of that title was the metre Bretagne which arrived in the port for the first time on February br On March an oil spill occurred in the harbour originating from the oil field at Wytch Farm run by Perenco The Poole Harbour Commissioners reported that around barrels of reservoir fluid had leaked into Poole Harbour from one of the oil field s pipelines The Environment Agency described it as a major incident br br br Geography and islands br br The entrance to Poole Harbour is from the east via Poole Bay and the English Channel Entering the harbour heading west on either side are the shores of Studland beach south west and Sandbanks in particular the Haven Hotel and the peninsula north east Directly ahead are several islands the largest of which is Brownsea Island br Four rivers drain into Poole harbour the largest being the River Frome which flows from the west through Dorchester and Wareham The others are the River Piddle the Corfe River and the Sherford River br br Following the harbour anti clockwise heading north east passes the built up residential settlements of Poole including Lilliput and Parkstone east About miles km north west of the entrance of the harbour is the entrance to Poole Quay and the Holes Bay see below Directly west of the main part of Poole is Hamworthy Continuing anti clockwise heading west around the Harbour are the settlements of Upton and Wareham as well as the outlet of the River Piddle This area of water within the Harbour is known as Wareham Channel and includes other places such as Rockley Sands br Continuing anti clockwise now heading south are the majority of the islands within the Harbour as well as several small channels and inlets To the west is Arne Bay and the Wych channel The majority of land in this area is heathland and there are few settlements as opposed to the eastern part of the Harbour Directly south is Long Island Round Island and Ower Bay Green Island Furzey Island and Brownsea Island in that order are to the east with Newton Bay and Brands Bay this area has several oil wells to the south This area of water is known as the South Deep Continuing anti clockwise comes back to the entrance to the Harbour and to Poole Bay with Studland beach immediately south east br Lytchett Bay lies to the north of the Harbour and flows into it through a narrow channel near the edge of the suburb of Hamworthy This is fed by the Sherford River br br br Holes Bay br br Holes Bay is a tidal inland lake which lies to the north of Poole Harbour It is a designated harbour quiet area The entrance to the bay is a small inlet from the main harbour Spanning the inlet are two bridges Poole Bridge and the new Twin Sails Bridge the latter officially opened in and cost around Access to Holes Bay for vessels with an air draft greater than metres ft is only possible when the bridges are lifted which occurs several fixed times daily and sometimes on request The new bridge is intended to help reduce traffic jams by ensuring at least one bridge is open to vehicular traffic at any one time br The bay contains Pergins Island and the South Western railway line runs west to east on a causeway across the bay To the north of the bay is Upton Country Park br Holes Bay is the location of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution RNLI training school attached to their Poole headquarters Uses of the bay include fishing kayaking and small leisure craft A large marina known as Cobbs Quay is on the west side of the bay On its east side the bay runs parallel to the A br br br Parkstone Bay br Parkstone Bay is named after the suburb of Parkstone Harbourside Park wraps around the bay br br br Islands of Poole Harbour br br Poole Harbour is the location of a number of islands of various sizes These islands include br br Brownsea Island is near the sea entrance at Sandbanks br Furzey Island is south of Brownsea Island br Green Island is directly south of Furzey island br Long Island is near the Arne Peninsula br Round Island br Gigger s Island is in the west of the Harbour near the River Piddle outlet br Drove Island is in the south of the Harbour in Brands Bay br Pergins Island is in the north of the Harbour in Holes Bay br Stone Island lies between Brownsea and Studland It is a ridge of gravel and sand possibly the remains of an old recurved shingle spit which is only visible between high tides and as such is a danger to sailors It is now gradually being submerged by rising sea level br br br Geology br br The harbour lies on a band of weak gravel and clay which is easily eroded by the rivers and sea This band is bordered by two bands of chalk the Purbeck Hills and Isle of Wight to the south and the Dorset Downs and South Downs to the north The clay extends west up the Frome valley to Dorchester and would originally have extended east beyond Portsmouth in Hampshire Before the last ice age the River Frome continued to flow east through what is now the Solent joining the Stour Beaulieu Test Itchen and Hamble before flowing into the English Channel to the east of the present day Isle of Wight A relatively resistant chalk ridge ran continuously from the Purbeck Hills to the Isle of Wight which the rivers could not break through br When the glaciers of the north of the island of Great Britain melted the south of England sank slightly flooding the Solent valley and Southampton Water to form their characteristic rias flooded estuaries About years ago increased erosion from the sea and the increased flow caused by the change in climate broke through the chalk hills cutting the Isle of Wight off from the Isle of Purbeck and flooding what is now the Solent and Christchurch Bay leaving Poole Harbour as the estuary of the Frome br br br Marine activity br br Once a major port freight transport has declined but the port is still served by regular cross Channel passenger ferries with Brittany Ferries offering a passenger and freight service to Cherbourg Condor Ferries operate to the Channel Islands and St Malo as well as joint high speed service with Brittany Ferries to Cherbourg br Coastal trading vessels are also frequent visitors unloading various cargos on the quaysides at Hamworthy and fleet of fishing vessels operates from the south end of Poole Quay There is considerable leisure usage of the harbour by a combination of yachts and other private craft cruise boats that ply the harbour and ferries that provide a passenger link to Brownsea Island The harbour is managed by the Poole Harbour Commissioners PHC who represent all aspects of commercial and leisure activity in the harbour Their duties include maintaining the shipping channels for the ferries and cargo vessels enforcing harbour speed limits improving port facilities and assisting with nature conservation br In November the main shipping channels into the harbour and the Port of Poole were dredged to accommodate modern ferries at all states of the tide The project was carried out by Van Oord and on completion the depth had been increased from to metres to ft Approximately million cubic metres of sand and silt were dredged from the approach channels to the Harbour and port and million m was made available to the local beaches of Poole Bournemouth and Purbeck for beach replenishment br Poole Harbour Commissioners define the main shipping channels in which leisure craft should take care as br br The Swash Channel from the Bar Buoy to the Chain Ferry br The Haven Channel from the Chain Ferry to buoy br The Middle Ship Channel from buoy to Stakes br The turning basin off the Ferry Port br The Little Channel from Stakes to Poole Bridge br br br Marinas br As well as the commercial activity discussed above Poole is a major centre for sailing and motor boating br br Poole Quay Boat Haven is the most central marina situated immediately east of the Town Quay on the main road through the town centre berth holders have to cross it to get to the showers br the Town Quay itself still accommodates larger visiting boats br Port of Poole Marina is a little south west of there close to the ferry terminal and caters only for resident boats no visitors br Poole Yacht Club is a little further west and welcomes visiting boats br Parkstone Bay Marina together with the private Parkstone Yacht Club are located in Parkstone Bay to the east br Cobbs Quay Marina is in Upton Bay to the north west accessed only when the town Bridge A is opened br Salterns Marina is by Lilliput and houses the former Poole Harbour Yacht Club br There is an enormous number of moorings in the harbour and many places to anchor br br br Ecology and nature conservation br br Much of the north side of the harbour is a built up area including the town of Poole and the conurbation which continues miles km eastwards along the coast The west and south sides of the harbour and part of the Purbeck Heritage Coast are important wildlife havens as are the five large islands in the harbour which are home to the endangered red squirrel The harbour is an area of international importance for wildlife conservation and is on the Ramsar list It borders three national nature reserves including the internationally important Studland and Godlingston Heath NNR and a number of local and non statutory nature reserves run by organisations such as the National Trust and RSPB notably Arne The mouth of the harbour is partially blocked by Sandbanks a spit on the north which is built up and part of Poole and by Studland to the south which is another important wildlife area br The harbour is very shallow in places and has extensive mud flat and salt marsh habitats as well as muddy and sandy shores and seagrass meadows Being an extremely popular recreation and tourism area means that the local authorities and organisations have to carefully manage the tourism to prevent damage to the habitats br The south shore of the harbour including Wytch Heath and Godlingstone Heath is open heathland of little agricultural use During the th century there was some afforestation with conifer plantations Around Wareham Forest in the west this has been for commercial forestry but on the southern shore the plantations conceal the Wytch Farm oil wells br Three bird species occur in internationally important numbers common shelduck pied avocet and black tailed godwit Other notable visitors include spoonbill Sandwich tern and Eurasian whimbrel Once rare little egrets are now seen regularly and in increasing numbers br On April ospreys nesting in Poole Harbour produced an egg the first in southern England in modern times The successful hatching is the first in years In August it was reported that one of the two chicks had been killed in a hawk attack In May the only breeding pair of ospreys have hatched their first two chicks of the year br br br Urbanisation and development br br Due to the ever increasing popularity of pleasure boating in the United Kingdom the harbour has seen a rapid increase in the private ownership of pleasure vessels over the past decade most of which are housed in private marinas around the harbour Due to this increase Poole has seen a rise in the number of maritime oriented businesses br With the popularity of watersports such as water skiing wakeboarding windsurfing and kitesurfing Poole Harbour Commissioners have designated areas within the harbour almost exclusively for sport participation virtually unrestricted from most regular harbour rules Poole is also fortunate in that wind conditions are variable wind conditions can be calm for sports such as wakeboarding and a short while later strong for sports such as windsurfing Most of these sports benefit from the harbour s generally flat water conditions As a result local watersport businesses operate around the harbour br Poole Tourism has developed and signed a number of trails and circular walks collectively called the Poole Harbour Trails as well as the Poole Heritage Cycle Route for cyclists br A freight only branch runs from Hamworthy railway station to Poole Docks However the line is fenced off at the Poole Docks level crossing with a run round loop provided at Hamworthy Park The line is currently served by a weekly
