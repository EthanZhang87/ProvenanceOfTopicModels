An amphibious all terrain vehicle or amphibious ATV or AATV is a small all wheel drive all terrain amphibious vehicle used for recreation farm hunting utility or industry tasks by enthusiasts and professionals worldwide They are legally off highway vehicles in many countries or at least restricted from use on express highways and motorways their use is generally extra urban br Amphibious ATVs frequently use a lightweight body tub with wide balloon tires and a simple drivetrain without any wheel suspension or steering the only cushioning is provided by the soft tires that also contribute to floatation in the water Steering is through differential steering also known as skid steering Models are frequently six wheel drive or eight wheel drive on larger models br They were marketed from the early s and quickly became popular predominantly for recreation in both the United States and Canada originally called all terrain vehicle ATV However after the introduction of cheaper small three and four wheeled off road motorcycles in the s and s these became more popular and the nomenclature ATV shifted in usage to refer to the latter non amphibious straddled little off road motorbikes br To distinguish the original class of vehicles from the newer straddled ATVs the amphibious ones now go by the classification of amphibious ATV br br br History br br Amphibious ATVs were made in the United States a decade before and wheeled ATVs were introduced by Honda and other Japanese manufacturers After the introduction of the Jiger in numerous manufacturers offered a number of similar small off road vehicles These vehicles were designed to float and were capable of traversing swamps ponds and streams as well as dry land Because they were smaller and much simpler in construction than amphibious cars they were much cheaper to produce and quickly gained considerable popularity By there were almost companies producing amphibious x vehicles There was even a professional racing association NATVA dedicated to the x holding numerous competitions across the US br In the early s however there was a rapid decline in sales of this type of ATVs forcing most manufacturers to cease production br br the oil crisis prompted many North Americans to tighten their belts and spend less on recreational vehicles br the introduction of the Honda ATC three wheeler offered an alternative in the range where a x would cost br The simple construction of the original ATVs attracted many companies that were interested in making a quick profit but underestimated the engineering needed leading to poor quality products that gave the industry a bad reputation br With most models utilizing stroke engines the x s did not run well unless properly maintained stroke engines were available however they were under powered with at most hp br Only a small number of manufacturers of this type of vehicle remain today br br br Characteristics br br Although many differing variants have been developed over the years most amphibious ATVs share most of the following characteristics In contrast to today s ANSI definition of an ATV a vehicle that travels on low pressure tires with a seat that is straddled by the single operator and with handlebars for steering control an AATV is intended for multiple riders sitting inside and will usually have two control sticks and in some cases a steering wheel or joystick rather than motorcycle type handle bars as stipulated in the current definition Typically constructed with a hard plastic or fiberglass watertight body tub AATVs usually have six or eight wheels all driven with low pressure around PSI balloon tires no suspension other than what the tires offer and no steering wheels Directional control is accomplished through differential steering just as on a tracked vehicle either by braking the wheels on the side of desired direction or by applying more throttle to the wheels on the opposite side Most contemporary designs use garden tractor type engines that will provide roughly mph km h top speed AATVs typically do not meet vehicle regulations in most countries and are therefore strictly Off Highway Vehicles OHV br Though not as fast as a straddled ATV the amphibious x and x can be operated with precision at slow speeds carry more passengers and cargo and has the ability to float Although the spinning action of the tires is enough to propel the vehicle through the water albeit slowly outboard motors can be added for extended water use On land the combination of a large number of wide wheels and tires low tire pressure and low vehicle weight all result in exceptionally low ground pressure high grip and off road ability For further enhanced off road snow and mud performance optional tracks can be mounted directly onto the wheels br br br Vintage Manufacturers br br A partial list of the more than manufacturers of AATVs in the s and s br br Jiger the world s first to produce ATVs starting in
