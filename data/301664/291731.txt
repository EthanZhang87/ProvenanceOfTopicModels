title: Seaplane
id: 291731
A seaplane is a powered fixed wing aircraft capable of taking off and landing alighting on water Seaplanes are usually divided into two categories based on their technological characteristics floatplanes and flying boats the latter are generally far larger and can carry far more Seaplanes that can also take off and land on airfields are in a subclass called amphibious aircraft or amphibians Seaplanes were sometimes called hydroplanes but currently this term applies instead to motor powered watercraft that use the technique of hydrodynamic lift to skim the surface of water when running at speed br The use of seaplanes gradually tapered off after World War II partially because of the investments in airports during the war but mainly because landplanes were less constrained by weather conditions that could result in sea states being too high to operate seaplanes while landplanes could continue to operate In the st century seaplanes maintain a few niche uses such as for aerial firefighting air transport around archipelagos and access to undeveloped or roadless areas some of which have numerous lakes In British English seaplane is sometimes used specifically to refer to a floatplane rather than a flying boat br br br Types br The word seaplane is used to describe two types of air water vehicles the floatplane and the flying boat br br A floatplane has slender floats mounted under the fuselage Two floats are common but other configurations are possible Only the floats of a floatplane normally come into contact with water The fuselage remains above water Some small land aircraft can be modified to become float planes and in general floatplanes are small aircraft Floatplanes are limited by their inability to handle wave heights typically greater than inches m These floats add to the empty weight of the airplane and to the drag coefficient resulting in reduced payload capacity slower rate of climb and slower cruise speed br br In a flying boat the main source of buoyancy is the fuselage which acts like a ship s hull in the water because the fuselage s underside has been hydrodynamically shaped to allow water to flow around it Most flying boats have small floats mounted on their wings to keep them stable Not all small seaplanes have been floatplanes but most large seaplanes have been flying boats with their great weight supported by their hulls br The term seaplane is used by some instead of floatplane This is the standard British usage This article treats both flying boats and floatplanes as types of seaplane in the US fashion br An amphibious aircraft can take off and land both on conventional runways and water A true seaplane can only take off and land on water There are amphibious flying boats and amphibious floatplanes as well as some hybrid designs e g floatplanes with retractable floats br Modern production seaplanes range in size from flying boat type light sport aircraft amphibians such as the Icon A and AirMax SeaMax to the lb ShinMaywa US and Beriev Be multi role amphibians Examples in between include the Dornier Seastar flying boat type seat utility amphibian and the Canadair CL amphibious water bomber The Viking Air DHC Twin Otter and Cessna Caravan utility aircraft have landing gear options which include amphibious floats br br br History br br Taking off on water was attempted by some early flight attempts but water take off and landing began in earnest in the s and seaplanes pioneered transatlantic routes and were used in World War I They continued to develop before World War II and had widespread use After World War II the creation of so many land airstrips meant water landings began to drift into special applications They continued in niches such as access in remote areas forest fire fighting and maritime patrol br br br Early pioneers br br The Frenchman Alphonse P naud filed the first patent for a flying machine with a boat hull and retractable landing gear in but Austrian Wilhelm Kress is credited with building the first seaplane Drachenflieger in although its two hp kW Daimler engines were inadequate for take off and it later sank when one of its two floats collapsed br On June Gabriel Voisin took off and landed on the River Seine with a towed kite glider on floats The first of his unpowered flights was yards m He later built a powered floatplane in partnership with Louis Bl riot but the machine was unsuccessful br Other pioneers also attempted to attach floats to aircraft in Britain Australia France and the United States br On March Frenchman Henri Fabre flew the first successful powered seaplane the Gnome Omega powered hydravion a trimaran floatplane Fabre s first successful take off and landing by a powered seaplane inspired other aviators and he designed floats for several other flyers The first hydro aeroplane competition was held in Monaco in March featuring aircraft using floats from Fabre Curtiss Tellier and Farman This led to the first scheduled seaplane passenger services at Aix les Bains using a five seat Sanchez Besa from August The French Navy ordered its first floatplane in On May Glenn L Martin flew a homemade seaplane in California setting records for distance and time br br In Fran ois Denhaut constructed the first seaplane with a fuselage forming a hull using various designs to give hydrodynamic lift at take off Its first successful flight was on April br Throughout and American pioneering aviator Glenn Curtiss developed his floatplane into the successful Curtiss Model D land plane which used a larger central float and sponsons Combining floats with wheels he made the first amphibian flights in February and was awarded the first Collier Trophy for US flight achievement From his experiments with a hulled seaplane resulted in the Model E and Model F which he called flying boats br In February the United States Navy took delivery of the Curtiss Model E and soon tested landings on and take offs from ships using the Curtiss Model D br There were experiments by aviators to adapt the Wright Model B to a water landing The first motion picture recorded from an airplane was from a Wright Model B floatplane by Frank Coffyn in The Wright Brothers widely celebrated for their breakthrough aircraft designs were slower to develop a seaplane Wilbur died in and the company was bogged down in lawsuits However by the Wright Brother company developed the Wright Model CH Flyer In the Wright company also came out withe Wright Model G Aerboat which was a seaplane with an enclosed cabin a first for the company the chief engineer of this version was Grover Loening br In Britain Captain Edward Wakefield and Oscar Gnosspelius began to explore the feasibility of flight from water in They decided to make use of Windermere in the Lake District England s largest lake The latter s first attempts to fly attracted large crowds though the aircraft failed to take off and required a re design of the floats incorporating features from the boat hulls of the lake s motor boat racing club member Isaac Borwick Meanwhile Wakefield ordered a floatplane similar to the design of the Fabre Hydravion By November both Gnosspelius and Wakefield had aircraft capable of flight from water and awaited suitable weather conditions Gnosspelius s flight was short lived as the aircraft crashed into the lake Wakefield s pilot however taking advantage of a light northerly wind successfully took off and flew at a height of feet m to Ferry Nab where he made a wide turn and returned for a perfect landing on the lake s surface br In Switzerland mile Tadd oli equipped the Dufaux biplane with swimmers and successfully took off in A seaplane was used during the Balkan Wars in when a Greek Astra Hydravion did a reconnaissance of the Turkish fleet and dropped four bombs br br br Birth of an industry br br In the Daily Mail newspaper put up a prize for the first non stop aerial crossing of the Atlantic which was soon enhanced by a further sum from the Women s Aerial League of Great Britain br American businessman Rodman Wanamaker became determined that the prize should go to an American aircraft and commissioned the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company to design and build an aircraft capable of making the flight Curtiss s development of the Flying Fish flying boat in brought him into contact with John Cyril Porte a retired Royal Navy Lieutenant aircraft designer and test pilot who was to become an influential British aviation pioneer Recognising that many of the early accidents were attributable to a poor understanding of handling while in contact with the water the pair s efforts went into developing practical hull designs to make the transatlantic crossing possible br The two years before World War I s breakout also saw the privately produced pair of Benoist XIV biplane flying boats designed by Thomas W Benoist initiate the start of the first heavier than air airline service anywhere in the world and the first airline service of any kind at all in the United States br At the same time the British boat building firm J Samuel White of Cowes on the Isle of Wight set up a new aircraft division and produced a flying boat in the United Kingdom This was displayed at the London Air Show at Olympia in In that same year a collaboration between the S E Saunders boatyard of East Cowes and the Sopwith Aviation Company produced the Bat Boat an aircraft with a consuta laminated hull that could operate from land or on water which today is called an amphibious aircraft The Bat Boat completed several landings on sea and on land and was duly awarded the Mortimer Singer Prize It was the first all British aeroplane capable of making six return flights over five miles within five hours br br In the US Wanamaker s commission built on Glen Curtiss s previous development and experience with the Curtiss Model F for the U S Navy which rapidly resulted in the America designed under Porte s supervision following his study and rearrangement of the flight plan the aircraft was a conventional biplane design with two bay unstaggered wings of unequal span with two pusher inline engines mounted side by side above the fuselage in the interplane gap Wingtip pontoons were attached directly below the lower wings near their tips The design later developed into the Model H resembled Curtiss s earlier flying boats but was built considerably larger so it could carry enough fuel to cover mi km The three crew members were accommodated in a fully enclosed cabin br Trials of the America began June with Porte also as Chief Test Pilot testing soon revealed serious shortcomings in the design it was under powered so the engines were replaced with more powerful tractor engines There was also a tendency for the nose of the aircraft to try to submerge as engine power increased while taxiing on water This phenomenon had not been encountered before since Curtiss s earlier designs had not used such powerful engines nor large fuel cargo loads and so were relatively more buoyant In order to counteract this effect Curtiss fitted fins to the sides of the bow to add hydrodynamic lift but soon replaced these with sponsons a type of underwater pontoon mounted in pairs on either side of a hull These sponsons or their engineering equivalents and the flared notched hull would remain a prominent feature of flying boat hull design in the decades to follow With the problem resolved preparations for the crossing resumed While the craft was found to handle heavily on takeoff and required rather longer take off distances than expected the full moon on August was selected for the trans Atlantic flight Porte was to pilot the America with George Hallett as co pilot and mechanic br br br World War I br Curtiss and Porte s plans were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I Porte sailed for England on August and rejoined the Navy as a member of the Royal Naval Air Service Appointed Squadron Commander of Royal Navy Air Station Hendon he soon convinced the Admiralty of the potential of flying boats and was put in charge of the naval air station at Felixstowe in Porte persuaded the Admiralty to commandeer and later purchase the America and a sister craft from Curtiss This was followed by an order for more similar aircraft one Model H and the remaining as Model H s Four examples of the latter were assembled in the UK by Saunders All of these were similar to the design of the America and indeed were all referred to as Americas in Royal Navy service The engines however were changed from the under powered hp Curtiss engines to hp Rolls Royce Falcon engines The initial batch was followed by an order for more totalling Americas overall during the war Porte also acquired permission to modify and experiment with the Curtiss aircraft br The Curtiss H s were soon found to have a number of problems they were underpowered their hulls were too weak for sustained operations and they had poor handling characteristics when afloat or taking off One flying boat pilot Major Theodore Douglas Hallam wrote that they were comic machines weighing well under two tons with two comic engines giving when they functioned horsepower and comic control being nose heavy with engines on and tail heavy in a glide br br At Felixstowe Porte made advances in flying boat design and developed a practical hull design with the distinctive Felixstowe notch br Porte s first design to be implemented in Felixstowe was the Felixstowe Porte Baby a large three engined biplane flying boat powered by one central pusher and two outboard tractor Rolls Royce Eagle engines br Porte modified an H with a new hull whose improved hydrodynamic qualities made taxiing take off and landing much more practical and called it the Felixstowe F br Porte s innovation of the Felixstowe notch enabled the craft to overcome suction from the water more quickly and break free for flight much more easily This made operating the craft far safer and more reliable The notch breakthrough would soon after evolve into a step with the rear section of the lower hull sharply recessed above the forward lower hull section and that characteristic became a feature of both flying boat hulls and seaplane floats The resulting aircraft would be large enough to carry sufficient fuel to fly long distances and could berth alongside ships to take on more fuel br Porte then designed a similar hull for the larger Curtiss H flying boat which while larger and more capable than the H s shared failings of a weak hull and poor water handling The combination of the new Porte designed hull this time fitted with two steps with the wings of the H and a new tail and powered by two Rolls Royce Eagle engines was named the Felixstowe F and first flew in July proving greatly superior to the Curtiss on which it was based It was used as the basis for all future designs It entered production as the Felixstowe F A being used as a patrol aircraft with about being completed by the end of World War I Another seventy were built and these were followed by two F c which were built at Felixstowe br In February the first prototype of the Felixstowe F was flown It was larger and heavier than the F giving it greater range and heavier bomb load but poorer agility Approximately Felixstowe F s were produced before the end of the war br br The Felixstowe F was intended to combine the good qualities of the F and F with the prototype first flying in May The prototype showed superior qualities to its predecessors but to ease production the production version was modified to make extensive use of components from the F which resulted in lower performance than the F A or F br Porte s final design at the Seaplane Experimental Station was the foot span five engined Felixstowe Fury triplane also known as the Porte Super Baby or PSB br F F and F flying boats were extensively employed by the Royal Navy for coastal patrols and to search for German U boats br In they were towed on lighters towards the northern German ports to extend their range on June this resulted in three F As engaging in a dogfight with ten German seaplanes shooting down two confirmed and four probables at no loss As a result of this action British flying boats were dazzle painted to aid identification in combat br br The Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company independently developed its designs into the small Model F the larger Model K several of which were sold to the Russian Naval Air Service and the Model C for the U S Navy Curtiss among others also built the Felixstowe F as the Curtiss F L based on the final Porte hull designs and powered by American Liberty engines br Meanwhile the pioneering flying boat designs of Fran ois Denhaut had been steadily developed by the Franco British Aviation Company into a range of practical craft Smaller than the Felixstowes several thousand FBAs served with almost all of the Allied forces as reconnaissance craft patrolling the North Sea Atlantic and Mediterranean Oceans br In Italy several seaplanes were developed starting with the L series and progressing with the M series The Macchi M in particular was extremely manoeuvrable and agile and matched the land based aircraft it had to fight Two hundred forty four were built in total br Towards the end of World War I the aircraft were flown by Italian Navy Aviation United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen Ensign Charles Hammann won the first Medal of Honor awarded to a United States naval aviator in an M br The German aircraft manufacturing company Hansa Brandenburg built flying boats starting with the model Hansa Brandenburg GW in and had a degree of military success with their Hansa Brandenburg W two seat floatplane fighter the following year being the primary aircraft flown by Imperial Germany s maritime fighter ace Friedrich Christiansen The Austro Hungarian firm Lohner Werke began building flying boats starting with the Lohner E in and the later widely copied Lohner L br br br Between the wars br br In September British company Supermarine started operating the first flying boat service in the world from Woolston to Le Havre in France but it was short lived br A Curtiss NC became the first airplane to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in crossing with multiple stops via the Azores Of the four that made the attempt only one completed the flight br In the first successful commercial flying boat service was introduced with flights to and from the Channel Islands After frequent appeals by the industry for subsidies the Government decided that nationalization was necessary and ordered five aviation companies to merge to form the state owned Imperial Airways of London IAL IAL became the international flag carrying British airline providing flying boat passenger and mail transport links between Britain and South Africa and India using aircraft such as the Short S Calcutta br In four Supermarine Southampton flying boats of the RAF Far East flight arrived in Melbourne Australia The flight was considered proof that flying boats had become a reliable means of long distance transport br br In the s flying boats made it possible to have regular air transport between the U S and Europe opening up new air travel routes to South America Africa and Asia Foynes Ireland and Botwood Newfoundland and Labrador were the terminals for many early transatlantic flights In areas where there were no airfields for land based aircraft flying boats could stop at small river lake or coastal stations to refuel and resupply The Pan Am Boeing Clipper flying boats brought new exotic destinations like the Far East within reach and came to represent the romance of flight br By mail from Australia was reaching Britain in days or less than half the time taken by sea In that year government tenders on both sides of the world invited applications to run new passenger and mail services between the ends of the Empire and Qantas and IAL were successful with a joint bid A company under combined ownership was then formed Qantas Empire Airways The new ten day service between Rose Bay New South Wales near Sydney and Southampton was such a success that the volume of mail soon exceeded aircraft storage space br A solution was found by the British government who had requested Short Brothers to design a large long range monoplane for IAL in Partner Qantas purchased six Short Empire flying boats br br Delivering the mail as quickly as possible generated a lot of competition and some innovative designs One variant of the Short Empire flying boats was the strange looking Maia and Mercury It was a four engined floatplane Mercury the winged messenger fixed on top of Maia a heavily modified Short Empire flying boat The larger Maia took off carrying the smaller Mercury loaded to a weight greater than it could take off with This allowed the Mercury to carry sufficient fuel for a direct trans Atlantic flight with the mail Unfortunately this was too complex and the Mercury had to be returned from America by ship The Mercury did set some distance records before in flight refuelling was adopted br Sir Alan Cobham devised a method of in flight refuelling in the s In the air the Short Empire could be loaded with more fuel than it could take off with Short Empire flying boats serving the trans Atlantic crossing were refueled over Foynes with the extra fuel load they could make a direct trans Atlantic flight A Handley Page H P Harrow was used as the fuel tanker br The German Dornier Do X flying boat was noticeably different from its UK and U S built counterparts It had wing like protrusions from the fuselage called sponsons to stabilize it on the water without the need for wing mounted outboard floats This feature was pioneered by Claudius Dornier during World War I on his Dornier Rs I giant flying boat and perfected on the Dornier Wal in The enormous Do X was powered by engines and carried people It flew across the Atlantic to the Americas in It was the largest flying boat of its time but was severely underpowered and was limited by a very low operational ceiling Only three were built with a variety of engines installed in an attempt to overcome the lack of power Two of these were sold to Italy br br br World War II br br The military value of flying boats was well recognized and every country bordering on water operated them in a military capacity at the outbreak of the war They were utilized in various tasks from anti submarine patrol to air sea rescue and gunfire spotting for battleships Aircraft such as the PBM Mariner patrol bomber PBY Catalina Short Sunderland and Grumman Goose recovered downed airmen and operated as scout aircraft over the vast distances of the Pacific Theater and Atlantic They also sank numerous submarines and found enemy ships In May the German battleship Bismarck was discovered by a PBY Catalina flying out of Castle Archdale Flying boat base Lower Lough Erne Northern Ireland br The largest flying boat of the war was the Blohm Voss BV which was also the heaviest plane to fly during World War II and the largest aircraft built and flown by any of the Axis Powers br br In November IAL was restructured into three separate companies British European Airways British Overseas Airways Corporation BOAC and British South American Airways which merged with BOAC in with the change being made official on April BOAC continued to operate flying boat services from the slightly safer confines of Poole Harbour during wartime returning to Southampton in When Italy entered the war in June the Mediterranean was closed to Allied planes and BOAC and Qantas operated the Horseshoe Route between Durban and Sydney using Short Empire flying boats br The Martin Company produced the prototype XPB M Mars based on their PBM Mariner patrol bomber with flight tests between and The Mars was converted by the Navy into a transport aircraft designated the XPB M R Satisfied with the performance twenty of the modified JRM Mars were ordered The first named Hawaii Mars was delivered in June but the Navy scaled back their order at the end of World War II buying only the five aircraft which were then on the production line The five Mars were completed and the last delivered in br br br Post War br br After World War II the use of flying boats rapidly declined for several reasons The ability to land on water became less of an advantage owing to the considerable increase in the number and length of land based runways during World War II Further as the speed and range of land based aircraft increased the commercial competitiveness of flying boats diminished their design compromised aerodynamic efficiency and speed to accomplish the feat of waterborne takeoff and landing Competing with new civilian jet aircraft like the de Havilland Comet and Boeing proved impossible br The Hughes H Hercules in development in the U S during the war was even larger than the BV but it did not fly until The Spruce Goose as the ton H was nicknamed was the largest flying boat ever to fly Carried out during Senate hearings into Hughes s use of government funds on its construction the short hop of about a mile km at feet m above the water by the Flying Lumberyard was claimed by Hughes as vindication of his efforts Cutbacks in expenditure after the war and the disappearance of its intended mission as a transatlantic transport left it no purpose br In the Royal Air Force began development of a small jet powered flying boat that it intended to use as an air defence aircraft optimised for the Pacific where the relatively calm sea conditions around the many archipelagos made the use of seaplanes easier By making the aircraft jet powered it was possible to design it with a hull rather than making it a floatplane The Saunders Roe SR A prototype first flew in and was relatively successful in terms of its performance and handling However by the end of the war carrier based aircraft were becoming more sophisticated and the need for the SR A evaporated br During the Berlin Airlift which lasted from June until August ten Sunderlands and two Hythes were used to transport goods from Finkenwerder on the Elbe near Hamburg to isolated Berlin landing on the Havelsee beside RAF Gatow until it iced over The Sunderlands were particularly used for transporting salt as their airframes were already protected against corrosion from seawater Transporting salt in standard aircraft risked rapid and severe structural corrosion in the event of a spillage In addition three Aquila flying boats were used during the airlift This is the only known operational use of flying boats within central Europe br BOAC ceased flying boat services out of Southampton in November br Bucking the trend in Aquila Airways was founded to serve destinations that were still inaccessible to land based aircraft This company operated Short S and Short S flying boats out of Southampton on routes to Madeira Las Palmas Lisbon Jersey Majorca Marseille Capri Genoa Montreux and Santa Margherita From to Aquila also operated a service from Southampton to Edinburgh and Glasgow The flying boats of Aquila Airways were also chartered for one off trips usually to deploy troops where scheduled services did not exist or where there were political considerations The longest charter in was from Southampton to the Falkland Islands In the flying boats were chartered for troop deployment trips to Freetown and Lagos and there was a special trip from Hull to Helsinki to relocate a ship s crew The airline ceased operations on September br br The technically advanced Saunders Roe Princess first flew in and later received a certificate of airworthiness Despite being the pinnacle of flying boat development none were sold though Aquila Airways reportedly attempted to buy them Of the three Princesses that were built two never flew and all were scrapped in In the late s Saunders Roe also produced the jet powered SR A flying boat fighter which did not progress beyond flying prototypes br br The U S Navy continued to operate flying boats notably the Martin P M Marlin until the early s The Navy even built a jet powered seaplane bomber the Martin Seamaster br The U S Coast Guard operated HU Albatross affectionately known as the goat well into the s retiring them as the airframes clocked out their flying thousand flying hours About twenty were still in service in the s and the last operation flight was in The aircraft was very popular with the Coast Guard due to its unique capabilities compared to other types and was noted for its versatility range and ability to land on water which was especially useful for water rescues br Ansett Australia operated a flying boat service from Rose Bay to Lord Howe Island until using Short Sandringhams br On December Pilot Tom Casey completed the first round the world flight in a floatplane with only water landings using a Cessna named Liberty II br br br Uses and operation br br Many modern civilian aircraft have a floatplane variant usually as utility transports to lakes and other remote areas Most of these are offered as third party modifications under a supplemental type certificate STC although there are several aircraft manufacturers that build floatplanes from scratch and a few that continue to build flying boats Some older flying boats remain in service for firefighting duty as well as the Canadair CL which remains in production as of and Chalk s Ocean Airways operated a fleet of Grumman Mallards in passenger service until service was suspended after a crash on December which was linked to maintenance not to design of the aircraft Purely water based seaplanes have largely been supplanted by amphibious aircraft br Seaplanes can only take off and land on water with little or no wave action and like other aircraft have trouble in extreme weather The size of waves a given design can withstand depends on among other factors the aircraft s size hull or float design and its weight all making for a much more unstable aircraft limiting actual operational days br Flying boats can typically handle rougher water and are generally more stable than floatplanes while on the water br Seaplanes are also used in remote areas such as the Alaskan and Canadian wilderness especially in areas with a large number of lakes convenient for takeoff and landing They may operate on a charter basis provide scheduled service or be operated by residents of the area for personal use There are seaplane operators that offer services between islands such as in the Caribbean Sea or the Maldives Usually these are converted from reliable commercial models and fitted for floats br One of the modern floatplane conversions under consideration in the s is floatplane version of the C for special military applications br br br See also br br List of flying boats and floatplanes br Ground effect vehicle br IAR br Observation seaplane br Seaplane tender br br br br br br External links br br
