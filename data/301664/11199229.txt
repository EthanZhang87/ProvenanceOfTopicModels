Paddleboarding is a water sport in which participants are propelled by a swimming motion using their arms while lying or kneeling on a paddleboard or surfboard in the ocean or other body of water Paddleboarding is usually performed in the open ocean with the participant paddling and surfing unbroken swells to cross between islands or journey from one coastal area to another br br br History br br br Polynesia br br Ships Artist John Webber accompanied Captain James Cook to the Sandwich Islands in and in the lower left foreground of his engraving is depicted a paddleboarder surfer br br br Thomas Edward Blake br Thomas Edward Blake is credited as the pioneer in paddleboard construction in the early s br While restoring historic Hawaiian boards in for the Bernice P Bishop Museum Blake built a replica of the previously ignored olo surfboard ridden by ancient Hawaiian ali i kings He lightened his redwood replica olo were traditionally made from wiliwili wood by drilling it full of holes which he then covered thus creating the first hollow board which led to creation of the modern paddleboard Two years later using this same ft m lb kg board Blake won the Pacific Coast Surfriding Championship first Mainland event integrating both surfing and paddling Blake then returned to Hawaii to break virtually every established paddling record available setting mi m and yd m records that stood until br In using his drastically modified chambered hollow board now weighing roughly lb kg which over the next decade he would tirelessly promote as a lifeguarding rescue tool Blake out paddled top California watermen Pete Peterson and Wally Burton in the first Mainland to Catalina crossing race mi km in hours minutes During the s Blake influenced hollow boards called cigar boards by reporters and later kook boxes by surfers would be used in roughly equal proportion to solid plank boards for both paddling and surfing until the new Hot Curl boards led wave riding in a new direction For paddleboarding however the basic principles of Blake s design remain relevant even today br br br Renaissance br br Paddleboarding experienced a renaissance in the early s after Los Angeles County lifeguard Rabbi Norm Shifren s Waterman Race mi km from Point Dume to Malibu inspired surf journalist Craig Lockwood to begin production on a high quality stock paddleboard known as the Waterman Its design which has arguably won more races than any other stock paddleboard remains a popular choice today br Shortly after L A surfboard shaper Joe Bark and San Diego shaper Mike Eaton began production and soon with Brian Szymanski s North County Paddleboards NCP became three of the largest U S paddleboard makers eventually producing nearly half of the estimated paddleboards made each year in the U S today br L A lifeguards Gibby Gibson and Buddy Bohn revived the Catalina Classic event in for a field of competitors Concurrently in Hawaii the annual Independence Day Paddleboard Race from Sunset to Waimea was drawing a few hundred competitors many using surfboards due to lack of proper paddleboards on the Islands As paddlers began ordering boards from the Mainland local surfboard shapers like Dennis Pang now one of Hawaii s largest paddleboard makers moved quickly to fill the local niche On both fronts paddleboarding has been consistently gaining momentum and popularity br In the sport of paddleboarding was making a comeback Once the domain of only dedicated watermen and big wave riders in the s and s the sport found a new set of acolytes on the North Shore of Oahu and in Honolulu at the Outrigger Canoe Club At that time Hawaii s top paddler was Dawson Jones After completing the mi km Catalina Classic from Catalina Island to Manhattan Beach Jones returned to Hawaii inspired to establish a race across the Ka iwi Channel In the race that is now known as the Paddleboard World Championships was born The race sells out with both prone and stand up paddleboarders SUP from around the world who compete in solo and team divisions br br br Olympics br Paddleboarding may be added to the Olympics and the Court of Arbitration for Sport will decide whether it is represented by the International Surfing Association or the International Canoe Federation br br br Equipment br Paddleboards are divided by length into three classes Stock Foot and Unlimited br Stock boards are ft m long and best for paddlers around lb kg or less Stock boards are easy to accelerate and fast in choppy water But with their short waterline they lack the calm water top speed of feet or Unlimited boards br foot class boards are arguably the best all around board At ft m in length they combine many of the best characteristics of stock boards with nearly the calm water speed of Unlimited boards Only about half of all races have a foot class br Unlimited boards are the fastest boards afloat Their speed comes from their long waterline and this also gives them a longer glide per stroke Though usually to ft to m long the class is defined as anything that floats and boards over ft m have been built They can be difficult to handle in choppy water and their length makes them harder to transport and store Modern Unlimited boards have rudders that are steered by a tiller between the paddler s feet br There is an additional board class the These boards are not used in the long ocean races that are run with the Stock Foot and Unlimited boards but are used in surf and sprint races class boards are known by several names Ten Six Sprint Board Surf Racer or Racing Mal br Paddleboarding can also be done on various pieces of equipment including surfboards Paddleboards are made of fiberglass epoxy and or carbon fiber An emerging paddleboard technology is constructing them from epoxy surfboard which is stronger and lighter than traditional fiberglass The cost of new boards ranges from to for custom boards Used boards that have been well kept are in high demand and can be sold fairly easily on paddleboard listing websites br br br Vessel registration fees br Some locations are starting to charge registration or other access fees for paddleboard use on public
